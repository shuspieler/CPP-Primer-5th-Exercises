THE SNOW QUEEN A TALE IN SEVEN STORIES 
FIRST STORY WHICH HAS TO DO WITH 
A MIRROR AND ITS FRAGMENTS NOW THEN! 
WE WILL BEGIN. WHEN THE STORY IS 
DONE YOU SHALL KNOW A GREAT DEAL 
MORE THAN YOU DO KNOW. HE WAS 
A TERRIBLY BAD HOBGOBLIN, A GOBLIN OF 
THE VERY WICKEDEST SORT AND, IN FACT, 
HE WAS THE DEVIL HIMSELF. ONE DAY 
THE DEVIL WAS IN A VERY GOOD 
HUMOR BECAUSE HE HAD JUST FINISHED A 
MIRROR WHICH HAD THIS PECULIAR POWER: EVERYTHING 
GOOD AND BEAUTIFUL THAT WAS REFLECTED IN 
IT SEEMED TO DWINDLE TO ALMOST NOTHING 
AT ALL, WHILE EVERYTHING THAT WAS WORTHLESS 
AND UGLY BECAME MOST CONSPICUOUS AND EVEN 
UGLIER THAN EVER. IN THIS MIRROR THE 
LOVELIEST LANDSCAPES LOOKED LIKE BOILED SPINACH, AND 
THE VERY BEST PEOPLE BECAME HIDEOUS, OR 
STOOD ON THEIR HEADS AND HAD NO 
STOMACHS. THEIR FACES WERE DISTORTED BEYOND ANY 
RECOGNITION, AND IF A PERSON HAD A 
FRECKLE IT WAS SURE TO SPREAD UNTIL 
IT COVERED BOTH NOSE AND MOUTH. "THAT'S 
VERY FUNNY!" SAID THE DEVIL. IF A 
GOOD, PIOUS THOUGHT PASSED THROUGH ANYONE'S MIND, 
IT SHOWED IN THE MIRROR AS A 
CARNAL GRIN, AND THE DEVIL LAUGHED ALOUD 
AT HIS INGENIOUS INVENTION. ALL THOSE WHO 
WENT TO THE HOBGOBLIN'S SCHOOL-FOR HE HAD 
A SCHOOL OF HIS OWN-TOLD EVERYONE THAT 
A MIRACLE HAD COME TO PASS. NOW, 
THEY ASSERTED, FOR THE VERY FIRST TIME 
YOU COULD SEE HOW THE WORLD AND 
ITS PEOPLE REALLY LOOKED. THEY SCURRIED ABOUT 
WITH THE MIRROR UNTIL THERE WAS NOT 
A PERSON ALIVE NOR A LAND ON 
EARTH THAT HAD NOT BEEN DISTORTED. THEN 
THEY WANTED TO FLY UP TO HEAVEN 
ITSELF, TO SCOFF AT THE ANGELS, AND 
OUR LORD. THE HIGHER THEY FLEW WITH 
THE MIRROR, THE WIDER IT GRINNED. THEY 
COULD HARDLY MANAGE TO HOLD IT. HIGHER 
THEY FLEW, AND HIGHER STILL, NEARER TO 
HEAVEN AND THE ANGELS. THEN THE GRINNING 
MIRROR TREMBLED WITH SUCH VIOLENCE THAT IT 
SLIPPED FROM THEIR HANDS AND FELL TO 
THE EARTH, WHERE IT SHATTERED INTO HUNDREDS 
OF MILLIONS OF BILLIONS OF BITS, OR 
PERHAPS EVEN MORE. AND NOW IT CAUSED 
MORE TROUBLE THAN IT DID BEFORE IT 
WAS BROKEN, BECAUSE SOME OF THE FRAGMENTS 
WERE SMALLER THAN A GRAIN OF SAND 
AND THESE WENT FLYING THROUGHOUT THE WIDE 
WORLD. ONCE THEY GOT IN PEOPLE'S EYES 
THEY WOULD STAY THERE. THESE BITS OF 
GLASS DISTORTED EVERYTHING THE PEOPLE SAW, AND 
MADE THEM SEE ONLY THE BAD SIDE 
OF THINGS, FOR EVERY LITTLE BIT OF 
GLASS KEPT THE SAME POWER THAT THE 
WHOLE MIRROR HAD POSSESSED. A FEW PEOPLE 
EVEN GOT A GLASS SPLINTER IN THEIR 
HEARTS, AND THAT WAS A TERRIBLE THING, 
FOR IT TURNED THEIR HEARTS INTO LUMPS 
OF ICE. SOME OF THE FRAGMENTS WERE 
SO LARGE THAT THEY WERE USED AS 
WINDOW PANES-BUT NOT THE KIND OF WINDOW 
THROUGH WHICH YOU SHOULD LOOK AT YOUR 
FRIENDS. OTHER PIECES WERE MADE INTO SPECTACLES, 
AND EVIL THINGS CAME TO PASS WHEN 
PEOPLE PUT THEM ON TO SEE CLEARLY 
AND TO SEE JUSTICE DONE. THE FIEND 
WAS SO TICKLED BY IT ALL THAT 
HE LAUGHED TILL HIS SIDES WERE SORE. 
BUT FINE BITS OF THE GLASS ARE 
STILL FLYING THROUGH THE AIR, AND NOW 
YOU SHALL HEAR WHAT HAPPENED. SECOND STORY 
A LITTLE BOY AND A LITTLE GIRL 
IN THE BIG CITY IT WAS SO 
CROWDED WITH HOUSES AND PEOPLE THAT FEW 
FOUND ROOM FOR EVEN A SMALL GARDEN 
AND MOST PEOPLE HAD TO BE CONTENT 
WITH A FLOWERPOT, BUT TWO POOR CHILDREN 
WHO LIVED THERE MANAGED TO HAVE A 
GARDEN THAT WAS A LITTLE BIGGER THAN 
A FLOWERPOT. THESE CHILDREN WERE NOT BROTHER 
AND SISTER, BUT THEY LOVED EACH OTHER 
JUST AS MUCH AS IF THEY HAD 
BEEN. THEIR PARENTS LIVED CLOSE TO ONE 
ANOTHER IN THE GARRETS OF TWO ADJOINING 
HOUSES. WHERE THE ROOFS MET AND WHERE 
THE RAIN GUTTER RAN BETWEEN THE TWO 
HOUSES, THEIR TWO SMALL WINDOWS FACED EACH 
OTHER. ONE HAD ONLY TO STEP ACROSS 
THE RAIN GUTTER TO GO FROM WINDOW 
TO WINDOW. IN THESE WINDOWS, THE PARENTS 
HAD A LARGE BOX WHERE THEY PLANTED 
VEGETABLES FOR THEIR USE, AND A LITTLE 
ROSE BUSH TOO. EACH BOX HAD A 
BUSH, WHICH THRIVED TO PERFECTION. THEN IT 
OCCURRED TO THE PARENTS TO PUT THESE 
BOXES ACROSS THE GUTTER, WHERE THEY VERY 
NEARLY REACHED FROM ONE WINDOW TO THE 
OTHER, AND LOOKED EXACTLY LIKE TWO WALLS 
OF FLOWERS. THE PEA PLANTS HUNG DOWN 
OVER THE BOXES, AND THE ROSE BUSHES 
THREW OUT LONG SPRAYS THAT FRAMED THE 
WINDOWS AND BENT OVER TOWARD EACH OTHER. 
IT WAS ALMOST LIKE A LITTLE TRIUMPHAL 
ARCH OF GREENERY AND FLOWERS. THE BOXES 
WERE VERY HIGH, AND THE CHILDREN KNEW 
THAT THEY WERE NOT TO CLIMB ABOUT 
ON THEM, BUT THEY WERE OFTEN ALLOWED 
TO TAKE THEIR LITTLE STOOLS OUT ON 
THE ROOF UNDER THE ROSES, WHERE THEY 
HAD A WONDERFUL TIME PLAYING TOGETHER. WINTER, 
OF COURSE, PUT AN END TO THIS 
PLEASURE. THE WINDOWS OFTEN FROSTED OVER COMPLETELY. 
BUT THEY WOULD HEAT COPPER PENNIES ON 
THE STOVE AND PRESS THESE HOT COINS 
AGAINST THE FROST-COATED GLASS. THEN THEY HAD 
THE FINEST OF PEEPHOLES, AS ROUND AS 
A RING, AND BEHIND THEM APPEARED A 
BRIGHT, FRIENDLY EYE, ONE AT EACH WINDOW-IT 
WAS THE LITTLE BOY AND THE LITTLE 
GIRL WHO PEEPED OUT. HIS NAME WAS 
KAY AND HERS WAS GERDA. WITH ONE 
SKIP THEY COULD JOIN EACH OTHER IN 
SUMMER, BUT TO VISIT TOGETHER IN THE 
WINTERTIME THEY HAD TO GO ALL THE 
WAY DOWNSTAIRS IN ONE HOUSE, AND CLIMB 
ALL THE WAY UPSTAIRS IN THE OTHER. 
OUTSIDE THE SNOW WAS WHIRLING. "SEE THE 
WHITE BEES SWARMING," THE OLD GRANDMOTHER SAID. 
"DO THEY HAVE A QUEEN BEE, TOO?" 
THE LITTLE BOY ASKED, FOR HE KNEW 
THAT REAL BEES HAVE ONE. "YES, INDEED 
THEY DO," THE GRANDMOTHER SAID. "SHE FLIES 
IN THE THICK OF THE SWARM. SHE 
IS THE BIGGEST BEE OF ALL, AND 
CAN NEVER STAY QUIETLY ON THE EARTH, 
BUT GOES BACK AGAIN TO THE DARK 
CLOUDS. MANY A WINTRY NIGHT SHE FLIES 
THROUGH THE STREETS AND PEERS IN THROUGH 
THE WINDOWS. THEN THEY FREEZE OVER IN 
A STRANGE FASHION, AS IF THEY WERE 
COVERED WITH FLOWERS." "OH YES, WE'VE SEEN 
THAT," BOTH THE CHILDREN SAID, AND SO 
THEY KNEW IT WAS TRUE. "CAN THE 
SNOW QUEEN COME IN HERE?" THE LITTLE 
GIRL ASKED. "WELL, LET HER COME!" CRIED 
THE BOY. "I WOULD PUT HER ON 
THE HOT STOVE AND MELT HER." BUT 
GRANDMOTHER STROKED HIS HEAD, AND TOLD THEM 
OTHER STORIES. THAT EVENING WHEN LITTLE KAY 
WAS AT HOME AND HALF READY FOR 
BED, HE CLIMBED ON THE CHAIR BY 
THE WINDOW AND LOOKED OUT THROUGH THE 
LITTLE PEEPHOLE. A FEW SNOWFLAKES WERE FALLING, 
AND THE LARGEST FLAKE OF ALL ALIGHTED 
ON THE EDGE OF ONE OF THE 
FLOWER BOXES. THIS FLAKE GREW BIGGER AND 
BIGGER, UNTIL AT LAST IT TURNED INTO 
A WOMAN, WHO WAS DRESSED IN THE 
FINEST WHITE GAUZE WHICH LOOKED AS IF 
IT HAD BEEN MADE FROM MILLIONS OF 
STAR-SHAPED FLAKES. SHE WAS BEAUTIFUL AND SHE 
WAS GRACEFUL, BUT SHE WAS ICE-SHINING, GLITTERING 
ICE. SHE WAS ALIVE, FOR ALL THAT, 
AND HER EYES SPARKLED LIKE TWO BRIGHT 
STARS, BUT IN THEM THERE WAS NEITHER 
REST NOR PEACE. SHE NODDED TOWARD THE 
WINDOW AND BECKONED WITH HER HAND. THE 
LITTLE BOY WAS FRIGHTENED, AND AS HE 
JUMPED DOWN FROM THE CHAIR IT SEEMED 
TO HIM THAT A HUGE BIRD FLEW 
PAST THE WINDOW. THE NEXT DAY WAS 
CLEAR AND COLD. THEN THE SNOW THAWED, 
AND SPRINGTIME CAME. THE SUN SHONE, THE 
GREEN GRASS SPROUTED, SWALLOWS MADE THEIR NESTS, 
WINDOWS WERE THROWN OPEN, AND ONCE AGAIN 
THE CHILDREN PLAYED IN THEIR LITTLE ROOF 
GARDEN, HIGH UP IN THE RAIN GUTTER 
ON TOP OF THE HOUSE. THAT SUMMER 
THE ROSES BLOOMED THEIR SPLENDID BEST. THE 
LITTLE GIRL HAD LEARNED A HYMN IN 
WHICH THERE WAS A LINE ABOUT ROSES 
THAT REMINDED HER OF THEIR OWN FLOWERS. 
SHE SANG IT TO THE LITTLE BOY, 
AND HE SANG IT WITH HER: "WHERE 
ROSES BLOOM SO SWEETLY IN THE VALE, 
THERE SHALL YOU FIND THE CHRIST CHILD, 
WITHOUT FAIL." THE CHILDREN HELD EACH OTHER 
BY THE HAND, KISSED THE ROSES, LOOKED 
UP AT THE LORD'S CLEAR SUNSHINE, AND 
SPOKE TO IT AS IF THE CHRIST 
CHILD WERE THERE. WHAT GLORIOUS SUMMER DAYS 
THOSE WERE, AND HOW BEAUTIFUL IT WAS 
OUT UNDER THOSE FRAGRANT ROSE BUSHES WHICH 
SEEMED AS IF THEY WOULD NEVER STOP 
BLOOMING. KAY AND GERDA WERE LOOKING AT 
A PICTURE BOOK OF BIRDS AND BEASTS 
ONE DAY, AND IT WAS THEN-JUST AS 
THE CLOCK IN THE CHURCH TOWER WAS 
STRIKING FIVE-THAT KAY CRIED: "OH! SOMETHING HURT 
MY HEART. AND NOW I'VE GOT SOMETHING 
IN MY EYE." THE LITTLE GIRL PUT 
HER ARM AROUND HIS NECK, AND HE 
BLINKED HIS EYE. NO, SHE COULDN'T SEE 
ANYTHING IN IT. "I THINK IT'S GONE," 
HE SAID. BUT IT WAS NOT GONE. 
IT WAS ONE OF THOSE SPLINTERS OF 
GLASS FROM THE MAGIC MIRROR. YOU REMEMBER 
THAT GOBLIN'S MIRROR-THE ONE WHICH MADE EVERYTHING 
GREAT AND GOOD THAT WAS REFLECTED IN 
IT APPEAR SMALL AND UGLY, BUT WHICH 
MAGNIFIED ALL EVIL THINGS UNTIL EACH BLEMISH 
LOOMED LARGE. POOR KAY! A FRAGMENT HAD 
PIERCED HIS HEART AS WELL, AND SOON 
IT WOULD TURN INTO A LUMP OF 
ICE. THE PAIN HAD STOPPED, BUT THE 
GLASS WAS STILL THERE. "WHY SHOULD YOU 
BE CRYING?" HE ASKED. "IT MAKES YOU 
LOOK SO UGLY. THERE'S NOTHING THE MATTER 
WITH ME." AND SUDDENLY HE TOOK IT 
INTO HIS HEAD TO SAY: "UGH! THAT 
ROSE IS ALL WORM-EATEN. AND LOOK, THIS 
ONE IS CROOKED. AND THESE ROSES, THEY 
ARE JUST AS UGLY AS THEY CAN 
BE. THEY LOOK LIKE THE BOXES THEY 
GROW IN." HE GAVE THE BOXES A 
KICK, AND BROKE OFF BOTH OF THE 
ROSES. "KAY! WHAT ARE YOU DOING?" THE 
LITTLE GIRL CRIED. WHEN HE SAW HOW 
IT UPSET HER, HE BROKE OFF ANOTHER 
ROSE AND THEN LEAPED HOME THROUGH HIS 
OWN WINDOW, LEAVING DEAR LITTLE GERDA ALL 
ALONE. AFTERWARDS, WHEN SHE BROUGHT OUT HER 
PICTURE BOOK, HE SAID IT WAS FIT 
ONLY FOR BABES IN THE CRADLE. AND 
WHENEVER GRANDMOTHER TOLD STORIES, HE ALWAYS BROKE 
IN WITH A "BUT-." IF HE COULD 
MANAGE IT HE WOULD STEAL BEHIND HER, 
PERCH A PAIR OF SPECTACLES ON HIS 
NOSE, AND IMITATE HER. HE DID THIS 
SO CLEVERLY THAT IT MADE EVERYBODY LAUGH, 
AND BEFORE LONG HE COULD MIMIC THE 
WALK AND THE TALK OF EVERYONE WHO 
LIVED ON THAT STREET. EVERYTHING THAT WAS 
ODD OR UGLY ABOUT THEM, KAY COULD 
MIMIC SO WELL THAT PEOPLE SAID, "THAT 
BOY HAS SURELY GOT A GOOD HEAD 
ON HIM!" BUT IT WAS THE GLASS 
IN HIS EYE AND THE GLASS IN 
HIS HEART THAT MADE HIM TEASE EVEN 
LITTLE GERDA, WHO LOVED HIM WITH ALL 
HER SOUL. NOW HIS GAMES WERE VERY 
DIFFERENT FROM WHAT THEY USED TO BE. 
THEY BECAME MORE SENSIBLE. WHEN THE SNOW 
WAS FLYING ABOUT ONE WINTRY DAY, HE 
BROUGHT A LARGE MAGNIFYING GLASS OUT OF 
DOORS AND SPREAD THE TAIL OF HIS 
BLUE COAT TO LET THE SNOWFLAKES FALL 
ON IT. "NOW LOOK THROUGH THE GLASS," 
HE TOLD GERDA. EACH SNOWFLAKE SEEMED MUCH 
LARGER, AND LOOKED LIKE A MAGNIFICENT FLOWER 
OR A TEN-POINTED STAR. IT WAS MARVELOUS 
TO LOOK AT. "LOOK, HOW ARTISTIC!" SAID 
KAY. "THEY ARE MUCH MORE INTERESTING TO 
LOOK AT THAN REAL FLOWERS, FOR THEY 
ARE ABSOLUTELY PERFECT. THERE ISN'T A FLAW 
IN THEM, UNTIL THEY START MELTING." A 
LITTLE WHILE LATER KAY CAME DOWN WITH 
HIS BIG GLOVES ON HIS HANDS AND 
HIS SLED ON HIS BACK. RIGHT IN 
GERDA'S EAR HE BAWLED OUT, "I'VE BEEN 
GIVEN PERMISSION TO PLAY IN THE BIG 
SQUARE WHERE THE OTHER BOYS ARE!" AND 
AWAY HE RAN. IN THE SQUARE SOME 
OF THE MORE ADVENTURESOME BOYS WOULD TIE 
THEIR LITTLE SLEDS ON BEHIND THE FARMER'S 
CARTS, TO BE PULLED ALONG FOR QUITE 
A DISTANCE. IT WAS WONDERFUL SPORT. WHILE 
THE FUN WAS AT ITS HEIGHT, A 
BIG SLEIGH DROVE UP. IT WAS PAINTED 
ENTIRELY WHITE, AND THE DRIVER WORE A 
WHITE, SHAGGY FUR CLOAK AND A WHITE, 
SHAGGY CAP. AS THE SLEIGH DROVE TWICE 
AROUND THE SQUARE, KAY QUICKLY HOOKED HIS 
LITTLE SLED BEHIND IT, AND DOWN THE 
STREET THEY WENT, FASTER AND FASTER. THE 
DRIVER TURNED AROUND IN A FRIENDLY FASHION 
AND NODDED TO KAY, JUST AS IF 
THEY WERE OLD ACQUAINTANCES. EVERY TIME KAY 
STARTED TO UNFASTEN HIS LITTLE SLEIGH, ITS 
DRIVER NODDED AGAIN, AND KAY HELD ON, 
EVEN WHEN THEY DROVE RIGHT OUT THROUGH 
THE TOWN GATE. THEN THE SNOW BEGAN 
TO FALL SO FAST THAT THE BOY 
COULD NOT SEE HIS HANDS IN FRONT 
OF HIM, AS THEY SPED ON. HE 
SUDDENLY LET GO THE SLACK OF THE 
ROPE IN HIS HANDS, IN ORDER SO 
GET LOOSE FROM THE BIG SLEIGH, BUT 
IT DID NO GOOD. HIS LITTLE SLED 
WAS TIED ON SECURELY, AND THEY WENT 
LIKE THE WIND. HE GAVE A LOUD 
SHOUT, BUT NOBODY HEARD HIM. THE SNOW 
WHIRLED AND THE SLEIGH FLEW ALONG. EVERY 
NOW AND THEN IT GAVE A JUMP, 
AS IF IT WERE CLEARING HEDGES AND 
DITCHES. THE BOY WAS TERROR-STRICKEN. HE TRIED 
TO SAY HIS PRAYERS, BUT ALL HE 
COULD REMEMBER WAS HIS MULTIPLICATION TABLES. THE 
SNOWFLAKES GOT BIGGER AND BIGGER, UNTIL THEY 
LOOKED LIKE BIG WHITE HENS. ALL OF 
A SUDDEN THE CURTAIN OF SNOW PARTED, 
AND THE BIG SLEIGH STOPPED AND THE 
DRIVER STOOD UP. THE FUR COAT AND 
THE CAP WERE MADE OF SNOW, AND 
IT WAS A WOMAN, TALL AND SLENDER 
AND BLINDING WHITE-SHE WAS THE SNOW QUEEN 
HERSELF. "WE HAVE MADE GOOD TIME," SHE 
SAID. "IS IT POSSIBLE THAT YOU TREMBLE 
FROM COLD? CRAWL UNDER MY BEAR COAT." 
SHE TOOK HIM UP IN THE SLEIGH 
BESIDE HER, AND AS SHE WRAPPED THE 
FUR ABOUT HIM HE FELT AS IF 
HE WERE SINKING INTO A SNOWDRIFT. "ARE 
YOU STILL COLD?" SHE ASKED, AND KISSED 
HIM ON THE FOREHEAD. BRER-R-R. THAT KISS 
WAS COLDER THAN ICE. HE FELT IT 
RIGHT DOWN TO HIS HEART, HALF OF 
WHICH WAS ALREADY AN ICY LUMP. HE 
FELT AS IF HE WERE DYING, BUT 
ONLY FOR A MOMENT. THEN HE FELT 
QUITE COMFORTABLE, AND NO LONGER NOTICED THE 
COLD. "MY SLED! DON'T FORGET MY SLED!" 
IT WAS THE ONLY THING HE THOUGHT 
OF. THEY TIED IT TO ONE OF 
THE WHITE HENS, WHICH FLEW ALONG AFTER 
THEM WITH THE SLED ON ITS BACK. 
THE SNOW QUEEN KISSED KAY ONCE MORE, 
AND THEN HE FORGOT LITTLE GERDA, AND 
GRANDMOTHER, AND ALL THE OTHERS AT HOME. 
"YOU WON'T GET ANY MORE KISSES NOW," 
SHE SAID, "OR ELSE I SHOULD KISS 
YOU TO DEATH." KAY LOOKED AT HER. 
SHE WAS SO BEAUTIFUL! A CLEVERER AND 
PRETTIER FACE HE COULD NOT IMAGINE. SHE 
NO LONGER SEEMED TO BE MADE OF 
ICE, AS SHE HAD SEEMED WHEN SHE 
SAT OUTSIDE HIS WINDOW AND BECKONED TO 
HIM. IN HIS EYES SHE WAS PERFECT, 
AND SHE WAS NOT AT ALL AFRAID. 
HE TOLD HER HOW HE COULD DO 
MENTAL ARITHMETIC EVEN WITH FRACTIONS, AND THAT 
HE KNEW THE SIZE AND POPULATION OF 
ALL THE COUNTRIES. SHE KEPT ON SMILING, 
AND HE BEGAN TO BE AFRAID THAT 
HE DID NOT KNOW AS MUCH AS 
HE THOUGHT HE DID. HE LOOKED UP 
AT THE GREAT BIG SPACE OVERHEAD, AS 
SHE FLEW WITH HIM HIGH UP ON 
THE BLACK CLOUDS, WHILE THE STORM WHISTLED 
AND ROARED AS IF IT WERE SINGING 
OLD BALLADS. THEY FLEW OVER FORESTS AND 
LAKES, OVER MANY A LAND AND SEA. 
BELOW THEM THE WIND BLEW COLD, WOLVES 
HOWLED, AND BLACK CROWS SCREAMED AS THEY 
SKIMMED ACROSS THE GLITTERING SNOW. BUT UP 
ABOVE THE MOON SHONE BRIGHT AND LARGE, 
AND ON IT KAY FIXED HIS EYES 
THROUGHOUT THAT LONG, LONG WINTER NIGHT. BY 
DAY HE SLEPT AT THE FEET OF 
THE SNOW QUEEN. THIRD STORY THE FLOWER 
GARDEN OF THE WOMAN SKILLED IN MAGIC 
HOW DID LITTLE GERDA GET ALONG WHEN 
KAY DID NOT COME BACK? WHERE COULD 
HE BE? NOBODY KNEW. NOBODY COULD GIVE 
THEM ANY NEWS OF HIM. ALL THAT 
THE BOYS COULD SAY WAS THAT THEY 
HAD SEEN HIM HITCH HIS LITTLE SLED 
TO A FINE BIG SLEIGH, WHICH HAD 
DRIVEN DOWN THE STREET AND OUT THROUGH 
THE TOWN GATE. NOBODY KNEW WHAT HAD 
BECOME OF KAY. MANY TEARS WERE SHED, 
AND LITTLE GERDA SOBBED HARDEST OF ALL. 
PEOPLE SAID THAT HE WAS DEAD-THAT HE 
MUST HAVE BEEN DROWNED IN THE RIVER 
NOT FAR FROM TOWN. AH, HOW GLOOMY 
THOSE LONG WINTER DAYS WERE! BUT SPRING 
AND ITS WARM SUNSHINE CAME AT LAST. 
"KAY IS DEAD AND GONE," LITTLE GERDA 
SAID. "I DON'T BELIEVE IT," SAID THE 
SUNSHINE. "HE'S DEAD AND GONE," SHE SAID 
TO THE SWALLOWS. "WE DON'T BELIEVE IT," 
THEY SANG. FINALLY LITTLE GERDA BEGAN TO 
DISBELIEVE IT TOO. ONE MORNING SHE SAID 
TO HERSELF: "I'LL PUT ON MY NEW 
RED SHOES, THE ONES KAY HAS NEVER 
SEEN, AND I'LL GO DOWN BY THE 
RIVER TO ASK ABOUT HIM." IT WAS 
VERY EARLY IN THE MORNING. SHE KISSED 
HER OLD GRANDMOTHER, WHO WAS STILL ASLEEP, 
PUT ON HER RED SHOES, AND ALL 
BY HERSELF SHE HURRIED OUT THROUGH THE 
TOWN GATE AND DOWN TO THE RIVER. 
"IS IT TRUE THAT YOU HAVE TAKEN 
MY OWN LITTLE PLAYMATE? I'LL GIVE YOU 
MY RED SHOES IF YOU WILL BRING 
HIM BACK TO ME." IT SEEMED TO 
HER THAT THE WAVES NODDED VERY STRANGELY. 
SO SHE TOOK OFF HER RED SHOES 
THAT WERE HER DEAREST POSSESSION, AND THREW 
THEM INTO THE RIVER. BUT THEY FELL 
NEAR THE SHORE, AND THE LITTLE WAVES 
WASHED THEM RIGHT BACK TO HER. IT 
SEEMED THAT THE RIVER COULD NOT TAKE 
HER DEAREST POSSESSION, BECAUSE IT DID NOT 
HAVE LITTLE KAY. HOWEVER, SHE WAS AFRAID 
THAT SHE HAD NOT THROWN THEM FAR 
ENOUGH, SO SHE CLAMBERED INTO A BOAT 
THAT LAY AMONG THE REEDS, WALKED TO 
THE END OF IT, AND THREW HER 
SHOES OUT INTO THE WATER AGAIN. BUT 
THE BOAT WAS NOT TIED, AND HER 
MOVEMENTS MADE IT DRIFT AWAY FROM THE 
BANK. SHE REALIZED THIS, AND TRIED TO 
GET ASHORE, BUT BY THE TIME SHE 
REACHED THE OTHER END OF THE BOAT 
IT WAS ALREADY MORE THAN A YARD 
FROM THE BANK, AND WAS FAST GAINING 
SPEED. LITTLE GERDA WAS SO FRIGHTENED THAT 
SHE BEGAN TO CRY, AND NO ONE 
WAS THERE TO HEAR HER EXCEPT THE 
SPARROWS. THEY COULD NOT CARRY HER TO 
LAND, BUT THEY FLEW ALONG THE SHORE 
TWITTERING, "WE ARE HERE! HERE WE ARE!" 
AS IF TO COMFORT HER. THE BOAT 
DRIFTED SWIFTLY DOWN THE STREAM, AND GERDA 
SAT THERE QUITE STILL, IN HER STOCKING 
FEET. HER LITTLE RED SHOES FLOATED ALONG 
BEHIND, BUT THEY COULD NOT CATCH UP 
WITH HER BECAUSE THE BOAT WAS GATHERING 
HEADWAY. IT WAS VERY PRETTY ON BOTH 
SIDES OF THE RIVER, WHERE THE FLOWERS 
WERE LOVELY, THE TREES WERE OLD, AND 
THE HILLSIDES AFFORDED PASTURE FOR CATTLE AND 
SHEEP. BUT NOT ONE SINGLE PERSON DID 
GERDA SEE. "PERHAPS THE RIVER WILL TAKE 
ME TO LITTLE KAY," SHE THOUGHT, AND 
THAT MADE HER FEEL MORE CHEERFUL. SHE 
STOOD UP AND WATCHED THE LOVELY GREEN 
BANKS FOR HOUR AFTER HOUR. THEN SHE 
CAME TO A LARGE CHERRY ORCHARD, IN 
WHICH THERE WAS A LITTLE HOUSE WITH 
STRANGE RED AND BLUE WINDOWS. IT HAD 
A THATCHED ROOF, AND OUTSIDE IT STOOD 
TWO WOODEN SOLDIERS, WHO PRESENTED ARMS TO 
EVERYONE WHO SAILED PAST. GERDA THOUGHT THEY 
WERE ALIVE, AND CALLED OUT TO THEM, 
BUT OF COURSE THEY DID NOT ANSWER 
HER. SHE DRIFTED QUITE CLOSE TO THEM 
AS THE CURRENT DROVE THE BOAT TOWARD 
THE BANK. GERDA CALLED EVEN LOUDER, AND 
AN OLD, OLD WOMAN CAME OUT OF 
THE HOUSE. SHE LEANED ON A CROOKED 
STICK; SHE HAD ON A BIG SUN 
HAT, AND ON IT WERE PAINTED THE 
MOST GLORIOUS FLOWERS. "YOU POOR LITTLE CHILD!" 
THE OLD WOMAN EXCLAIMED. "HOWEVER DID YOU 
GET LOST ON THIS BIG SWIFT RIVER, 
AND HOWEVER DID YOU DRIFT SO FAR 
INTO THE GREAT WIDE WORLD?" THE OLD 
WOMAN WADED RIGHT INTO THE WATER, CAUGHT 
HOLD OF THE BOAT WITH HER CROOKED 
STICK, PULLED IT IN TO SHORE, AND 
LIFTED LITTLE GERDA OUT OF IT. GERDA 
WAS VERY GLAD TO BE ON DRY 
LAND AGAIN, BUT SHE FELT A LITTLE 
AFRAID OF THIS STRANGE OLD WOMAN, WHO 
SAID TO HER: "COME AND TELL ME 
WHO YOU ARE, AND HOW YOU GOT 
HERE." GERDA TOLD HER ALL ABOUT IT. 
THE WOMAN SHOOK HER HEAD AND SAID, 
"HMM, HMM!" AND WHEN GERDA HAD TOLD 
HER EVERYTHING AND ASKED IF SHE HADN'T 
SEEN LITTLE KAY, THE WOMAN SAID HE 
HAD NOT YET COME BY, BUT THAT 
HE MIGHT BE ALONG ANY DAY NOW. 
AND SHE TOLD GERDA NOT TO TAKE 
IT SO TO HEART, BUT TO TASTE 
HER CHERRIES AND TO LOOK AT HER 
FLOWERS. THESE WERE MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN ANY 
PICTURE BOOK, AND EACH ONE HAD A 
STORY TO TELL. THEN SHE LED GERDA 
BY THE HAND INTO HER LITTLE HOUSE, 
AND THE OLD WOMAN LOCKED THE DOOR. 
THE WINDOWS WERE PLACED HIGH UP ON 
THE WALLS, AND THROUGH THEIR RED, BLUE, 
AND YELLOW PANES THE SUNLIGHT STREAMED IN 
A STRANGE MIXTURE OF ALL THE COLORS 
THERE ARE. BUT ON THE TABLE WERE 
THE MOST DELICIOUS CHERRIES, AND GERDA, WHO 
WAS NO LONGER AFRAID, ATE AS MANY 
AS SHE LIKED. WHILE SHE WAS EATING 
THEM, THE OLD WOMAN COMBED HER HAIR 
WITH A GOLDEN COMB. GERDA'S PRETTY HAIR 
FELL IN SHINING YELLOW RINGLETS ON EITHER 
SIDE OF A FRIENDLY LITTLE FACE THAT 
WAS AS ROUND AND BLOOMING AS A 
ROSE. "I'VE SO OFTEN WISHED FOR A 
DEAR LITTLE GIRL LIKE YOU," THE OLD 
WOMAN TOLD HER. "NOW YOU'LL SEE HOW 
WELL THE TWO OF US WILL GET 
ALONG." WHILE HER HAIR WAS BEING COMBED, 
GERDA GRADUALLY FORGOT ALL ABOUT KAY, FOR 
THE OLD WOMAN WAS SKILLED IN MAGIC. 
BUT SHE WAS NOT A WICKED WITCH. 
SHE ONLY DABBLED IN MAGIC TO AMUSE 
HERSELF, BUT SHE WANTED VERY MUCH TO 
KEEP LITTLE GERDA. SO SHE WENT OUT 
INTO HER GARDEN AND POINTED HER CROOKED 
STICK AT ALL THE ROSE BUSHES. IN 
THE FULL BLOOM OF THEIR BEAUTY, ALL 
OF THEM SANK DOWN INTO THE BLACK 
EARTH, WITHOUT LEAVING A SINGLE TRACE BEHIND. 
THE OLD WOMAN WAS AFRAID THAT IF 
GERDA SAW THEM THEY WOULD REMIND HER 
SO STRONGLY OF HER OWN ROSES, AND 
OF LITTLE KAY, THAT SHE WOULD RUN 
AWAY AGAIN. THEN GERDA WAS LED INTO 
THE FLOWER GARDEN. HOW FRAGRANT AND LOVELY 
IT WAS! EVERY KNOWN FLOWER OF EVERY 
SEASON WAS THERE IN FULL BLOOM. NO 
PICTURE BOOK WAS EVER SO PRETTY AND 
GAY. GERDA JUMPED FOR JOY, AND PLAYED 
IN THE GARDEN UNTIL THE SUN WENT 
DOWN BEHIND THE TALL CHERRY TREES. THEN 
SHE WAS TUCKED INTO A BEAUTIFUL BED, 
UNDER A RED SILK COVERLET QUILTED WITH 
BLUE VIOLETS. THERE SHE SLEPT, AND THERE 
SHE DREAMED AS GLORIOUSLY AS ANY QUEEN 
ON HER WEDDING DAY. THE NEXT MORNING 
SHE AGAIN WENT OUT INTO THE WARM 
SUNSHINE TO PLAY WITH THE FLOWERS-AND THIS 
SHE DID FOR MANY A DAY. GERDA 
KNEW EVERY FLOWER BY HEART, AND, PLENTIFUL 
THOUGH THEY WERE, SHE ALWAYS FELT THAT 
THERE WAS ONE MISSING, BUT WHICH ONE 
SHE DIDN'T QUITE KNOW. ONE DAY SHE 
SAT LOOKING AT THE OLD WOMAN'S SUN 
HAT, AND THE PRETTIEST OF ALL THE 
FLOWERS PAINTED ON IT WAS A ROSE. 
THE OLD WOMAN HAD FORGOTTEN THIS ROSE 
ON HER HAT WHEN SHE MADE THE 
REAL ROSES DISAPPEAR IN THE EARTH. BUT 
THAT'S JUST THE SORT OF THING THAT 
HAPPENS WHEN ONE DOESN'T STOP TO THINK. 
"WHY AREN'T THERE ANY ROSES HERE?" SAID 
GERDA. SHE RUSHED OUT AMONG THE FLOWER 
BEDS, AND SHE LOOKED AND SHE LOOKED, 
BUT THERE WASN'T A ROSE TO BE 
SEEN. THEN SHE SAT DOWN AND CRIED. 
BUT HER HOT TEARS FELL ON THE 
VERY SPOT WHERE A ROSE BUSH HAD 
SUNK INTO THE GROUND, AND WHEN HER 
WARM TEARS MOISTENED THE EARTH THE BUSH 
SPRANG UP AGAIN, AS FULL OF BLOSSOMS 
AS WHEN IT DISAPPEARED. GERDA HUGGED IT, 
AND KISSED THE ROSES. SHE REMEMBERED HER 
OWN PRETTY ROSES, AND THOUGHT OF LITTLE 
KAY. "OH HOW LONG I HAVE BEEN 
DELAYED," THE LITTLE GIRL SAID. "I SHOULD 
HAVE BEEN LOOKING FOR KAY. DON'T YOU 
KNOW WHERE HE IS?" SHE ASKED THE 
ROSES. "DO YOU THINK THAT HE IS 
DEAD AND GONE?" "HE ISN'T DEAD," THE 
ROSES TOLD HER. "WE HAVE BEEN DOWN 
IN THE EARTH WHERE THE DEAD PEOPLE 
ARE, BUT KAY IS NOT THERE." "THANK 
YOU," SAID LITTLE GERDA, WHO WENT TO 
ALL THE OTHER FLOWERS, PUT HER LIPS 
NEAR THEM AND ASKED, "DO YOU KNOW 
WHERE LITTLE KAY IS?" BUT EVERY FLOWER 
STOOD IN THE SUN, AND DREAMED ITS 
OWN FAIRY TALE, OR ITS STORY. THOUGH 
GERDA LISTENED TO MANY, MANY OF THEM, 
NOT ONE OF THE FLOWERS KNEW ANYTHING 
ABOUT KAY. WHAT DID THE TIGER LILY 
SAY? "DO YOU HEAR THE DRUM? BOOM, 
BOOM! IT WAS ONLY TWO NOTES, ALWAYS 
BOOM, BOOM! HEAR THE WOMEN WAIL. HEAR 
THE PRIESTS CHANT. THE HINDOO WOMAN IN 
HER LONG RED ROBE STANDS ON THE 
FUNERAL PYRE. THE FLAMES RISE AROUND HER 
AND HER DEAD HUSBAND, BUT THE HINDOO 
WOMAN IS THINKING OF THAT LIVING MAN 
IN THE CROWD AROUND THEM. SHE IS 
THINKING OF HIM WHOSE EYES ARE BURNING 
HOTTER THAN THE FLAMES-OF HIM WHOSE FIERY 
GLANCES HAVE PIERCED HER HEART MORE DEEPLY 
THAN THESE FLAMES THAT SOON WILL BURN 
HER BODY TO ASHES. CAN THE FLAME 
OF THE HEART DIE IN THE FLAME 
OF THE FUNERAL PYRE?" "I DON'T UNDERSTAND 
THAT AT ALL," LITTLE GERDA SAID. "THAT'S 
MY FAIRY TALE," SAID THE LILY. WHAT 
DID THE TRUMPET FLOWER SAY? "AN ANCIENT 
CASTLE RISES HIGH FROM A NARROW PATH 
IN THE MOUNTAINS. THE THICK IVY GROWS 
LEAF UPON LEAF WHERE IT CLIMBS TO 
THE BALCONY. THERE STANDS A BEAUTIFUL MAIDEN. 
SHE LEANS OUT OVER THE BALUSTRADE TO 
LOOK DOWN THE PATH. NO ROSE ON 
ITS STEM IS AS GRACEFUL AS SHE, 
NOR IS ANY APPLE BLOSSOM IN THE 
BREEZE SO LIGHT. HEAR THE RUSTLE OF 
HER SILK GOWN, SIGHING, 'WILL HE NEVER 
COME?'" "DO YOU MEAN KAY?" LITTLE GERDA 
ASKED. "I AM TALKING ABOUT MY STORY, 
MY OWN DREAM," THE TRUMPET FLOWER REPLIED. 
WHAT DID THE LITTLE SNOWDROP SAY? "BETWEEN 
THE TREES A BOARD HANGS BY TWO 
ROPES. IT IS A SWING. TWO PRETTY 
LITTLE GIRLS, WITH FROCKS AS WHITE AS 
SNOW, AND LONG GREEN RIBBONS FLUTTERING FROM 
THEIR HATS, ARE SWINGING. THEIR BROTHER, WHO 
IS BIGGER THAN THEY ARE, STANDS BEHIND 
THEM ON THE SWING, WITH HIS ARMS 
AROUND THE ROPES TO HOLD HIMSELF. IN 
ONE HAND HE HAS A LITTLE CUP, 
AND IN THE OTHER A CLAY PIPE. 
HE IS BLOWING SOAP BUBBLES, AND AS 
THE SWING FLIES THE BUBBLES FLOAT OFF 
IN ALL THEIR CHANGING COLORS. THE LAST 
BUBBLE IS STILL CLINGING TO THE BOWL 
OF HIS PIPE, AND FLUTTERING IN THE 
AIR AS THE SWING SWEEPS TO AND 
FRO. A LITTLE BLACK DOG, LIGHT AS 
A BUBBLE, IS STANDING ON HIS HIND 
LEGS AND TRYING TO GET UP IN 
THE SWING. BUT IT DOES NOT STOP. 
HIGH AND LOW THE SWING FLIES, UNTIL 
THE DOG LOSES HIS BALANCE, BARKS, AND 
LOSES HIS TEMPER. THEY TEASE HIM, AND 
THE BUBBLE BURSTS. A SWINGING BOARD PICTURED 
IN A BUBBLE BEFORE IT BROKE-THAT IS 
MY STORY." "IT MAY BE A VERY 
PRETTY STORY, BUT YOU TOLD IT VERY 
SADLY AND YOU DIDN'T MENTION KAY AT 
ALL." WHAT DID THE HYACINTHS SAY? "THERE 
WERE THREE SISTERS, QUITE TRANSPARENT AND VERY 
FAIR. ONE WORE A RED DRESS, THE 
SECOND WORE A BLUE ONE, AND THE 
THIRD WENT ALL IN WHITE. HAND IN 
HAND THEY DANCED IN THE CLEAR MOONLIGHT, 
BESIDE A CALM LAKE. THEY WERE NOT 
ELFIN FOLK. THEY WERE HUMAN BEINGS. THE 
AIR WAS SWEET, AND THE SISTERS DISAPPEARED 
INTO THE FOREST. THE FRAGRANCE OF THE 
AIR GREW SWEETER. THREE COFFINS, IN WHICH 
LIE THE THREE SISTERS, GLIDE OUT OF 
THE FOREST AND ACROSS THE LAKE. THE 
FIREFLIES HOVER ABOUT THEM LIKE LITTLE FLICKERING 
LIGHTS. ARE THE DANCING SISTERS SLEEPING OR 
ARE THEY DEAD? THE FRAGRANCE OF THE 
FLOWERS SAYS THEY ARE DEAD, AND THE 
EVENING BELL TOLLS FOR THEIR FUNERAL." "YOU 
ARE MAKING ME VERY UNHAPPY," LITTLE GERDA 
SAID. "YOUR FRAGRANCE IS SO STRONG THAT 
I CANNOT HELP THINKING OF THOSE DEAD 
SISTERS. OH, COULD LITTLE KAY REALLY BE 
DEAD? THE ROSES HAVE BEEN DOWN UNDER 
THE GROUND, AND THEY SAY NO." "DING, 
DONG," TOLLED THE HYACINTH BELLS. "WE DO 
NOT TOLL FOR LITTLE KAY. WE DO 
NOT KNOW HIM. WE ARE SIMPLY SINGING 
OUR SONG-THE ONLY SONG WE KNOW." AND 
GERDA WENT ON TO THE BUTTERCUP THAT 
SHONE AMONG ITS GLOSSY GREEN LEAVES. "YOU 
ARE LIKE A BRIGHT LITTLE SUN," SAID 
GERDA. "TELL ME, DO YOU KNOW WHERE 
I CAN FIND MY PLAYMATE?" AND THE 
BUTTERCUP SHONE BRIGHTLY AS IT LOOKED UP 
AT GERDA. BUT WHAT SORT OF SONG 
WOULD A BUTTERCUP SING? IT CERTAINLY WOULDN'T 
BE ABOUT KAY. "IN A SMALL COURTYARD, 
GOD'S SUN WAS SHINING BRIGHTLY ON THE 
VERY FIRST DAY OF SPRING. ITS BEAMS 
GLANCED ALONG THE WHITE WALL OF THE 
HOUSE NEXT DOOR, AND CLOSE BY GREW 
THE FIRST YELLOW FLOWERS OF SPRING SHINING 
LIKE GOLD IN THE WARM SUNLIGHT. AN 
OLD GRANDMOTHER WAS SITTING OUTSIDE IN HER 
CHAIR. HER GRANDDAUGHTER, A POOR BUT VERY 
PRETTY MAIDSERVANT, HAD JUST COME HOME FOR 
A LITTLE VISIT. SHE KISSED HER GRANDMOTHER, 
AND THERE WAS GOLD, A HEART FULL 
OF GOLD, IN THAT KISS. GOLD ON 
HER LIPS, GOLD IN HER DREAMS, AND 
GOLD ABOVE IN THE MORNING BEAMS. THERE, 
I'VE TOLD YOU MY LITTLE STORY," SAID 
THE BUTTERCUP. "OH, MY POOR OLD GRANDMOTHER," 
SAID GERDA. "SHE WILL MISS ME SO. 
SHE MUST BE GRIEVING FOR ME AS 
MUCH AS SHE DID FOR LITTLE KAY. 
BUT I'LL SOON GO HOME AGAIN, AND 
I'LL BRING KAY WITH ME. THERE'S NO 
USE ASKING THE FLOWERS ABOUT HIM. THEY 
DON'T KNOW ANYTHING EXCEPT THEIR OWN SONGS, 
AND THEY HAVEN'T ANY NEWS FOR ME." 
THEN SHE TUCKED UP HER LITTLE SKIRTS 
SO THAT SHE COULD RUN AWAY FASTER, 
BUT THE NARCISSUS TAPPED AGAINST HER LEG 
AS SHE WAS JUMPING OVER IT. SO 
SHE STOPPED AND LEANED OVER THE TALL 
FLOWER. "PERHAPS YOU HAVE SOMETHING TO TELL 
ME," SHE SAID. WHAT DID THE NARCISSUS 
SAY? "I CAN SEE MYSELF! I CAN 
SEE MYSELF! OH, HOW SWEET IS MY 
OWN FRAGRANCE! UP IN THE NARROW GARRET 
THERE IS A LITTLE DANCER, HALF DRESSED. 
FIRST SHE STANDS ON ONE LEG. THEN 
SHE STANDS ON BOTH, AND KICKS HER 
HEELS AT THE WHOLE WORLD. SHE IS 
AN ILLUSION OF THE STAGE. SHE POURS 
WATER FROM THE TEAPOT OVER A PIECE 
OF CLOTH SHE IS HOLDING-IT IS HER 
BODICE. CLEANLINESS IS SUCH A VIRTUE! HER 
WHITE DRESS HANGS FROM A HOOK. IT 
TOO HAS BEEN WASHED IN THE TEAPOT, 
AND DRIED ON THE ROOF. SHE PUTS 
IT ON, AND TIES A SAFFRON SCARF 
AROUND HER NECK TO MAKE THE DRESS 
SEEM WHITER. POINT YOUR TOES! SEE HOW 
STRAIGHT SHE BALANCES ON THAT SINGLE STEM. 
I CAN SEE MYSELF! I CAN SEE 
MYSELF!" "I'M NOT INTERESTED," SAID GERDA. "WHAT 
A THING TO TELL ME ABOUT!" SHE 
RAN TO THE END OF THE GARDEN, 
AND THOUGH THE GATE WAS FASTENED SHE 
WORKED THE RUSTY LATCH TILL IT GAVE 
WAY AND THE GATE FLEW OPEN. LITTLE 
GERDA SCAMPERED OUT INTO THE WIDE WORLD 
IN HER BARE FEET. SHE LOOKED BACK 
THREE TIMES, BUT NOBODY CAME AFTER HER. 
AT LAST SHE COULD RUN NO FARTHER, 
AND SHE SAT DOWN TO REST ON 
A BIG STONE, AND WHEN SHE LOOKED 
UP SHE SAW THAT SUMMER HAD GONE 
BY, AND IT WAS LATE IN THE 
FALL. SHE COULD NEVER HAVE GUESSED IT 
INSIDE THE BEAUTIFUL GARDEN WHERE THE SUN 
WAS ALWAYS SHINING, AND THE FLOWERS OF 
EVERY SEASON WERE ALWAYS IN FULL BLOOM. 
"GRACIOUS! HOW LONG I'VE DALLIED," GERDA SAID. 
"FALL IS ALREADY HERE. I CAN'T REST 
ANY LONGER." SHE GOT UP TO RUN 
ON, BUT HOW FOOTSORE AND TIRED SHE 
WAS! AND HOW COLD AND BLEAK EVERYTHING 
AROUND HER LOOKED! THE LONG LEAVES OF 
THE WILLOW TREE HAD TURNED QUITE YELLOW, 
AND DAMP PUFFS OF MIST DROPPED FROM 
THEM LIKE DROPS OF WATER. ONE LEAF 
AFTER ANOTHER FELL TO THE GROUND. ONLY 
THE BLACKTHORN STILL BORE FRUIT, AND ITS 
FRUIT WAS SO SOUR THAT IT SET 
YOUR TEETH ON EDGE. OH, HOW DREARY 
AND GRAY THE WIDE WORLD LOOKED. FOURTH 
STORY THE PRINCE AND THE PRINCESS THE 
NEXT TIME THAT GERDA WAS FORCED TO 
REST, A BIG CROW CAME HOPPING ACROSS 
THE SNOW IN FRONT OF HER. FOR 
A LONG TIME HE HAD BEEN WATCHING 
HER AND COCKING HIS HEAD TO ONE 
SIDE, AND NOW HE SAID, "CAW, CAW! 
GOOD CAW DAY!" HE COULD NOT SAY 
IT ANY BETTER, BUT HE FELT KINDLY 
INCLINED TOWARD THE LITTLE GIRL, AND ASKED 
HER WHERE SHE WAS GOING IN THE 
GREAT WIDE WORLD, ALL ALONE. GERDA UNDERSTOOD 
HIM WHEN HE SAID "ALONE," AND SHE 
KNEW ITS MEANING ALL TOO WELL. SHE 
TOLD THE CROW THE WHOLE STORY OF 
HER LIFE, AND ASKED IF HE HADN'T 
SEEN KAY. THE CROW GRAVELY NODDED HIS 
HEAD AND CAWED, "MAYBE I HAVE, MAYBE 
I HAVE!" "WHAT! DO YOU REALLY THINK 
YOU HAVE?" THE LITTLE GIRL CRIED, AND 
ALMOST HUGGED THE CROW TO DEATH AS 
SHE KISSED HIM. "GENTLY, GENTLY!" SAID THE 
CROW. "I THINK THAT IT MAY HAVE 
BEEN LITTLE KAY THAT I SAW, BUT 
IF IT WAS, THEN HE HAS FORGOTTEN 
YOU FOR THE PRINCESS." "DOES HE LIVE 
WITH A PRINCESS?" GERDA ASKED. "YES. LISTEN!" 
SAID THE CROW. "BUT IT IS SO 
HARD FOR ME TO SPEAK YOUR LANGUAGE. 
IF YOU UNDERSTAND CROW TALK, I CAN 
TELL YOU MUCH MORE EASILY." "I DON'T 
KNOW THAT LANGUAGE," SAID GERDA. "MY GRANDMOTHER 
KNOWS IT, JUST AS WELL AS SHE 
KNOWS BABY TALK, AND I DO WISH 
I HAD LEARNED IT." "NO MATTER," SAID 
THE CROW. "I'LL TELL YOU AS WELL 
AS I CAN, THOUGH THAT WON'T BE 
ANY TOO GOOD." AND HE TOLD HER 
ALL THAT HE KNEW. "IN THE KINGDOM 
WHERE WE ARE NOW, THERE IS A 
PRINCESS WHO IS UNCOMMONLY CLEVER, AND NO 
WONDER. SHE HAS READ ALL THE NEWSPAPERS 
IN THE WORLD AND FORGOTTEN THEM AGAIN 
- THAT'S HOW CLEVER SHE IS. WELL, 
NOT LONG AGO SHE WAS SITTING ON 
HER THRONE. THAT'S BY NO MEANS AS 
MUCH FUN AS PEOPLE SUPPOSE, SO SHE 
FELL TO HUMMING AN OLD TUNE, AND 
THE REFRAIN OF IT HAPPENED TO RUN: 
"WHY, OH, WHY, SHOULDN'T I GET MARRIED?" 
" 'WHY, THAT'S AN IDEA!' SAID SHE. 
AND SHE MADE UP HER MIND TO 
MARRY AS SOON AS SHE COULD FIND 
THE SORT OF HUSBAND WHO COULD GIVE 
A GOOD ANSWER WHEN ANYONE SPOKE TO 
HIM, INSTEAD OF ONE OF THOSE FELLOWS 
WHO MERELY STAND AROUND LOOKING IMPRESSIVE, FOR 
THAT IS SO TIRESOME. SHE HAD THE 
DRUMS DRUBBED TO CALL TOGETHER ALL HER 
LADIES-IN-WAITING, AND WHEN THEY HEARD WHAT SHE 
HAD IN MIND THEY WERE DELIGHTED. " 
'OH, WE LIKE THAT!' THEY SAID. 'WE 
WERE JUST THINKING THE VERY SAME THING.' 
"BELIEVE ME," SAID THE CROW, "EVERY WORD 
I TELL YOU IS TRUE. I HAVE 
A TAME LADYLOVE WHO HAS THE RUN 
OF THE PALACE, AND I HAD THE 
WHOLE STORY STRAIGHT FROM HER." OF COURSE 
HIS LADYLOVE WAS ALSO A CROW, FOR 
BIRDS OF A FEATHER WILL FLOCK TOGETHER. 
"THE NEWSPAPERS IMMEDIATELY CAME OUT WITH A 
BORDER OF HEARTS AND THE INITIALS OF 
THE PRINCESS, AND YOU COULD READ AN 
ANNOUNCEMENT THAT ANY PRESENTABLE YOUNG MAN MIGHT 
GO TO THE PALACE AND TALK WITH 
HER. THE ONE WHO SPOKE BEST, AND 
WHO SEEMED MOST AT HOME IN THE 
PALACE, WOULD BE CHOSEN BY THE PRINCESS 
AS HER HUSBAND. "YES, YES," SAID THE 
CROW, "BELIEVE ME, THAT'S AS TRUE AS 
IT IS THAT HERE I SIT. MEN 
FLOCKED TO THE PALACE, AND THERE WAS 
MUCH CROWDING AND CRUSHING, BUT ON NEITHER 
THE FIRST NOR THE SECOND DAY WAS 
ANYONE CHOSEN. OUT IN THE STREET THEY 
WERE ALL GLIB TALKERS, BUT AFTER THEY 
ENTERED THE PALACE GATE WHERE THE GUARDSMEN 
WERE STATIONED IN THEIR SILVER-BRAIDED UNIFORMS, AND 
AFTER THEY CLIMBED UP THE STAIRCASE LINED 
WITH FOOTMEN IN GOLD-EMBROIDERED LIVERY, THEY ARRIVED 
IN THE BRILLIANTLY LIGHTED RECEPTION HALLS WITHOUT 
A WORD TO SAY. AND WHEN THEY 
STOOD IN FRONT OF THE PRINCESS ON 
HER THRONE, THE BEST THEY COULD DO 
WAS TO ECHO THE LAST WORD OF 
HER REMARKS, AND SHE DIDN'T CARE TO 
HEAR IT REPEATED. "IT WAS JUST AS 
IF EVERYONE IN THE THRONE ROOM HAD 
HIS STOMACH FILLED WITH SNUFF AND HAD 
FALLEN ASLEEP; FOR AS SOON AS THEY 
WERE BACK IN THE STREETS THERE WAS 
NO STOPPING THEIR TALK. "THE LINE OF 
CANDIDATES EXTENDED ALL THE WAY FROM THE 
TOWN GATES TO THE PALACE. I SAW 
THEM MYSELF," SAID THE CROW. "THEY GOT 
HUNGRY AND THEY GOT THIRSTY, BUT FROM 
THE PALACE THEY GOT NOTHING-NOT EVEN A 
GLASS OF LUKEWARM WATER. TO BE SURE, 
SOME OF THE CLEVER CANDIDATES HAD BROUGHT 
SANDWICHES WITH THEM, BUT THEY DID NOT 
SHARE THEM WITH THEIR NEIGHBORS. EACH MAN 
THOUGHT, 'JUST LET HIM LOOK HUNGRY, THEN 
THE PRINCESS WON'T TAKE HIM!' " "BUT 
KAY, LITTLE KAY," GERDA INTERRUPTED, "WHEN DID 
HE COME? WAS HE AMONG THOSE PEOPLE?" 
"GIVE ME TIME, GIVE ME TIME! WE 
ARE JUST COMING TO HIM. ON THE 
THIRD DAY A LITTLE PERSON, WITH NEITHER 
HORSE NOR CARRIAGE, STRODE BOLDLY UP TO 
THE PALACE. HIS EYES SPARKLED THE WAY 
YOURS DO, AND HE HAD HANDSOME LONG 
HAIR, BUT HIS CLOTHES WERE POOR." "OH, 
THAT WAS KAY!" GERDA SAID, AND CLAPPED 
HER HANDS IN GLEE. "NOW I'VE FOUND 
HIM." "HE HAD A LITTLE KNAPSACK ON 
HIS BACK," THE CROW TOLD HER. "NO, 
THAT MUST HAVE BEEN HIS SLED," SAID 
GERDA. "HE WAS CARRYING IT WHEN HE 
WENT AWAY." "MAYBE SO," THE CROW SAID. 
"I DIDN'T LOOK AT IT CAREFULLY. BUT 
MY TAME LADYLOVE TOLD ME THAT WHEN 
HE WENT THROUGH THE PALACE GATES AND 
SAW THE GUARDSMEN IN SILVER, AND ON 
THE STAIRCASE THE FOOTMEN IN GOLD, HE 
WASN'T AT ALL TAKEN ABACK. HE NODDED 
AND HE SAID TO THEM: " 'IT 
MUST BE VERY TIRESOME TO STAND ON 
THE STAIRS. I'D RATHER GO INSIDE.' "THE 
HALLS WERE BRILLIANTLY LIGHTED. MINISTERS OF STATE 
AND PRIVY COUNCILORS WERE WALKING ABOUT BAREFOOTED, 
CARRYING GOLDEN TRAYS IN FRONT OF THEM. 
IT WAS ENOUGH TO MAKE ANYONE FEEL 
SOLEMN, AND HIS BOOTS CREAKED DREADFULLY, BUT 
HE WASN'T A BIT AFRAID." "THAT CERTAINLY 
MUST HAVE BEEN KAY," SAID GERDA. "I 
KNOW HE WAS WEARING NEW BOOTS. I 
HEARD THEM CREAKING IN GRANDMOTHER'S ROOM." "OH, 
THEY CREAKED ALL RIGHT," SAID THE CROW. 
"BUT IT WAS LITTLE ENOUGH HE CARED 
AS HE WALKED STRAIGHT TO THE PRINCESS, 
WHO WAS SITTING ON A PEARL AS 
BIG AS A SPINNING WHEEL. ALL THE 
LADIES-IN-WAITING WITH THEIR ATTENDANTS AND THEIR ATTENDANTS' 
ATTENDANTS, AND ALL THE LORDS-IN-WAITING WITH THEIR 
GENTLEMEN AND THEIR GENTLEMEN'S MEN, EACH OF 
WHOM HAD HIS PAGE WITH HIM, WERE 
STANDING THERE, AND THE NEARER THEY STOOD 
TO THE DOOR THE MORE ARROGANT THEY 
LOOKED. THE GENTLEMEN'S MEN'S PAGES, WHO ALWAYS 
WORE SLIPPERS, WERE ALMOST TOO ARROGANT TO 
LOOK AS THEY STOOD AT THE THRESHOLD." 
"THAT MUST HAVE BEEN TERRIBLE!" LITTLE GERDA 
EXCLAIMED. "AND YET KAY WON THE PRINCESS?" 
"IF I WEREN'T A CROW, I WOULD 
HAVE MARRIED HER MYSELF, FOR ALL THAT 
I'M ENGAGED TO ANOTHER. THEY SAY HE 
SPOKE AS WELL AS I DO WHEN 
I SPEAK MY CROW LANGUAGE. OR SO 
MY TAME LADYLOVE TELLS ME. HE WAS 
DASHING AND HANDSOME, AND HE WAS NOT 
THERE TO COURT THE PRINCESS BUT TO 
HEAR HER WISDOM. THIS HE LIKED, AND 
SHE LIKED HIM." "OF COURSE IT WAS 
KAY," SAID GERDA. "HE WAS SO CLEVER 
THAT HE COULD DO MENTAL ARITHMETIC EVEN 
WITH FRACTIONS. OH, PLEASE TAKE ME TO 
THE PALACE." "THAT'S EASY ENOUGH TO SAY," 
SAID THE CROW, "BUT HOW CAN WE 
MANAGE IT? I'LL TALK IT OVER WITH 
MY TAME LADYLOVE, AND SHE MAY BE 
ABLE TO SUGGEST SOMETHING, BUT I MUST 
WARN YOU THAT A LITTLE GIRL LIKE 
YOU WILL NEVER BE ADMITTED." "OH, YES 
I SHALL," SAID GERDA. "WHEN KAY HEARS 
ABOUT ME, HE WILL COME OUT TO 
FETCH ME AT ONCE." "WAIT FOR ME 
BESIDE THAT STILE," THE CROW SAID. HE 
WAGGED HIS HEAD AND OFF HE FLEW. 
DARKNESS HAD SET IN WHEN HE GOT 
BACK. "CAW, CAW!" HE SAID. "MY LADYLOVE 
SENDS YOU HER BEST WISHES, AND HERE'S 
A LITTLE LOAF OF BREAD FOR YOU. 
SHE FOUND IT IN THE KITCHEN, WHERE 
THEY HAVE ALL THE BREAD THEY NEED, 
AND YOU MUST BE HUNGRY. YOU SIMPLY 
CAN'T GET INTO THE PALACE WITH THOSE 
BARE FEET. THE GUARDSMEN IN SILVER AND 
THE FOOTMEN IN GOLD WOULD NEVER PERMIT 
IT. BUT DON'T YOU CRY. WE'LL FIND 
A WAY. MY LADYLOVE KNOWS OF A 
LITTLE BACK STAIRCASE THAT LEADS UP TO 
THE BEDROOM, AND SHE KNOWS WHERE THEY 
KEEP THE KEY TO IT." THEN THEY 
WENT INTO THE GARDEN AND DOWN THE 
WIDE PROMENADE WHERE THE LEAVES WERE FALLING 
ONE BY ONE. WHEN, ONE BY ONE, 
THE LIGHTS WENT OUT IN THE PALACE, 
THE CROW LED LITTLE GERDA TO THE 
BACK DOOR, WHICH STOOD AJAR. OH, HOW 
HER HEART DID BEAT WITH FEAR AND 
LONGING. IT WAS JUST AS IF SHE 
WERE ABOUT TO DO SOMETHING WRONG, YET 
SHE ONLY WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT 
THIS REALLY WAS LITTLE KAY. YES, TRULY 
IT MUST BE KAY, SHE THOUGHT, AS 
SHE RECALLED HIS SPARKLING EYES AND HIS 
LONG HAIR. SHE REMEMBERED EXACTLY HOW HE 
LOOKED WHEN HE USED TO SMILE AT 
HER AS THEY SAT UNDER THE ROSES 
AT HOME. WOULDN'T HE BE GLAD TO 
SEE HER! WOULDN'T HE BE INTERESTED IN 
HEARING HOW FAR SHE HAD COME TO 
FIND HIM, AND HOW SAD THEY HAD 
ALL BEEN WHEN HE DIDN'T COME HOME. 
SHE WAS SO FRIGHTENED, AND YET SO 
HAPPY. NOW THEY WERE ON THE STAIRWAY. 
A LITTLE LAMP WAS BURNING ON A 
CUPBOARD, AND THERE STOOD THE TAME CROW, 
COCKING HER HEAD TO LOOK AT GERDA, 
WHO MADE THE CURTSY THAT HER GRANDMOTHER 
HAD TAUGHT HER. "MY FIANCé HAS TOLD 
ME MANY CHARMING THINGS ABOUT YOU, DEAR 
YOUNG LADY," SHE SAID. "YOUR BIOGRAPHY, AS 
ONE MIGHT SAY, IS VERY TOUCHING. KINDLY 
TAKE THE LAMP AND I SHALL LEAD 
THE WAY. WE SHALL KEEP STRAIGHT AHEAD, 
WHERE WE AREN'T APT TO RUN INTO 
ANYONE." "IT SEEMS TO ME THAT SOMEONE 
IS ON THE STAIRS BEHIND US," SAID 
GERDA. THINGS BRUSHED PAST, AND FROM THE 
SHADOWS ON THE WALL THEY SEEMED TO 
BE HORSES WITH SPINDLY LEGS AND WAVING 
MANES. AND THERE WERE SHADOWS OF HUNTSMEN, 
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, ON HORSEBACK. "THOSE ARE 
ONLY DREAMS," SAID THE CROW. "THEY COME 
TO TAKE THE THOUGHTS OF THEIR ROYAL 
MASTERS OFF TO THE CHASE. THAT'S JUST 
AS WELL, FOR IT WILL GIVE YOU 
A GOOD OPPORTUNITY TO SEE THEM WHILE 
THEY SLEEP. BUT I TRUST THAT, WHEN 
YOU RISE TO HIGH POSITION AND POWER, 
YOU WILL SHOW A GRATEFUL HEART." "TUT 
TUT! YOU'VE NO NEED TO SAY THAT," 
SAID THE FOREST CROW. NOW THEY ENTERED 
THE FIRST ROOM. IT WAS HUNG WITH 
ROSE-COLORED SATIN, EMBROIDERED WITH FLOWERS. THE DREAM 
SHADOWS WERE FLITTING BY SO FAST THAT 
GERDA COULD NOT SEE THE LORDS AND 
LADIES. HALL AFTER MAGNIFICENT HALL QUITE BEWILDERED 
HER, UNTIL AT LAST THEY REACHED THE 
ROYAL BEDROOM. THE CEILING OF IT WAS 
LIKE THE TOP OF A HUGE PALM 
TREE, WITH LEAVES OF GLASS, COSTLY GLASS. 
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROOM TWO 
BEDS HUNG FROM A MASSIVE STEM OF 
GOLD. EACH OF THEM LOOKED LIKE A 
LILY. ONE BED WAS WHITE, AND THERE 
LAY THE PRINCESS. THE OTHER WAS RED, 
AND THERE GERDA HOPED TO FIND LITTLE 
KAY. SHE BENT ONE OF THE SCARLET 
PETALS AND SAW THE NAPE OF A 
LITTLE BROWN NECK. SURELY THIS MUST BE 
KAY. SHE CALLED HIS NAME ALOUD AND 
HELD THE LAMP NEAR HIM. THE DREAMS 
ON HORSEBACK PRANCED INTO THE ROOM AGAIN, 
AS HE AWOKE-AND TURNED HIS HEAD-AND IT 
WAS NOT LITTLE KAY AT ALL. THE 
PRINCE ONLY RESEMBLED KAY ABOUT THE NECK, 
BUT HE WAS YOUNG AND HANDSOME. THE 
PRINCESS PEEKED OUT OF HER LILY-WHITE BED, 
AND ASKED WHAT HAD HAPPENED. LITTLE GERDA 
CRIED AND TOLD THEM ALL ABOUT HERSELF, 
AND ABOUT ALL THAT THE CROWS HAD 
DONE FOR HER. "POOR LITTLE THING," THE 
PRINCE AND THE PRINCESS SAID. THEY PRAISED 
THE CROWS, AND SAID THEY WEREN'T THE 
LEAST BIT ANGRY WITH THEM, BUT NOT 
TO DO IT AGAIN. FURTHERMORE, THEY SHOULD 
HAVE A REWARD. "WOULD YOU RATHER FLY 
ABOUT WITHOUT ANY RESPONSIBILITIES," SAID THE PRINCESS, 
"OR WOULD YOU CARE TO BE APPOINTED 
COURT CROWS FOR LIFE, WITH RIGHTS TO 
ALL SCRAPS FROM THE KITCHEN?" BOTH THE 
CROWS BOWED LOW AND BEGGED FOR PERMANENT 
OFFICE, FOR THEY THOUGHT OF THEIR FUTURE 
AND SAID IT WAS BETTER TO PROVIDE 
FOR THEIR "OLD AGE," AS THEY CALLED 
IT. THE PRINCE GOT UP, AND LET 
GERDA HAVE HIS BED. IT WAS THE 
UTMOST THAT HE COULD DO. SHE CLASPED 
HER LITTLE HANDS AND THOUGHT, "HOW NICE 
THE PEOPLE AND THE BIRDS ARE." SHE 
CLOSED HER EYES, FELL PEACEFULLY ASLEEP, AND 
ALL THE DREAMS CAME FLYING BACK AGAIN. 
THEY LOOKED LIKE ANGELS, AND THEY DREW 
A LITTLE SLED ON WHICH KAY SAT. 
HE NODDED TO HER, BUT THIS WAS 
ONLY IN A DREAM, SO IT ALL 
DISAPPEARED WHEN SHE WOKE UP. THE NEXT 
DAY SHE WAS DRESSED FROM HER HEAD 
TO HER HEELS IN SILK AND IN 
VELVET TOO. THEY ASKED HER TO STAY 
AT THE PALACE AND HAVE A NICE 
TIME THERE, BUT INSTEAD SHE BEGGED THEM 
TO LET HER HAVE A LITTLE CARRIAGE, 
A LITTLE HORSE, AND A PAIR OF 
LITTLE BOOTS, SO THAT SHE COULD DRIVE 
OUT INTO THE WIDE WORLD TO FIND 
KAY. THEY GAVE HER A PAIR OF 
BOOTS, AND ALSO A MUFF. THEY DRESSED 
HER AS NICELY AS COULD BE AND, 
WHEN SHE WAS READY TO GO, THERE 
AT THE GATE STOOD A BRAND NEW 
CARRIAGE OF PURE GOLD. ON IT THE 
COAT OF ARMS OF THE PRINCE AND 
THE PRINCESS GLISTENED LIKE A STAR. THE 
COACHMAN, THE FOOTMAN, AND THE POSTILIONS-FOR POSTILIONS 
THERE WERE-ALL WORE GOLDEN CROWNS. THE PRINCE 
AND THE PRINCESS THEMSELVES HELPED HER INTO 
THE CARRIAGE, AND WISHED HER GODSPEED. THE 
FOREST CROW, WHO WAS NOW A MARRIED 
MAN, ACCOMPANIED HER FOR THE FIRST THREE 
MILES, AND SAT BESIDE GERDA, FOR IT 
UPSET HIM TO RIDE BACKWARD. THE OTHER 
CROW STOOD BESIDE THE GATE AND WAVED 
HER WINGS. SHE DID NOT ACCOMPANY THEM 
BECAUSE SHE WAS SUFFERING FROM A HEADACHE, 
BROUGHT ON BY EATING TOO MUCH IN 
HER NEW POSITION. INSIDE, THE CARRIAGE WAS 
LINED WITH SUGARED COOKIES, AND THE SEATS 
WERE FILLED WITH FRUIT AND GINGERBREAD. "FARE 
YOU WELL, FARE YOU WELL," CALLED THE 
PRINCE AND PRINCESS. LITTLE GERDA CRIED AND 
THE CROW CRIED TOO, FOR THE FIRST 
FEW MILES. THEN THE CROW SAID GOOD-BY, 
AND THAT WAS THE SADDEST LEAVE-TAKING OF 
ALL. HE FLEW UP INTO A TREE 
AND WAVED HIS BIG BLACK WINGS AS 
LONG AS HE COULD SEE THE CARRIAGE, 
WHICH FLASHED AS BRIGHTLY AS THE SUN. 
FIFTH STORY THE LITTLE ROBBER GIRL THE 
CARRIAGE ROLLED ON INTO A DARK FOREST. 
LIKE A BLAZING TORCH, IT SHONE IN 
THE EYES OF SOME ROBBERS. THEY COULD 
NOT BEAR IT. "THAT'S GOLD! THAT'S GOLD!" 
THEY CRIED. THEY SPRANG FORWARD, SEIZED THE 
HORSES, KILLED THE LITTLE POSTILIONS, THE COACHMAN, 
AND THE FOOTMAN, AND DRAGGED LITTLE GERDA 
OUT OF THE CARRIAGE. "HOW PLUMP AND 
HOW TENDER SHE LOOKS, JUST AS IF 
SHE'D BEEN FATTENED ON NUTS!" CRIED THE 
OLD ROBBER WOMAN, WHO HAD A LONG 
BRISTLY BEARD, AND LONG EYEBROWS THAT HUNG 
DOWN OVER HER EYES. "SHE LOOKS LIKE 
A FAT LITTLE LAMB. WHAT A DAINTY 
DISH SHE WILL BE!" AS SHE SAID 
THIS SHE DREW OUT HER KNIFE, A 
DREADFUL, FLASHING THING. "OUCH!" THE OLD WOMAN 
HOWLED. AT JUST THAT MOMENT HER OWN 
LITTLE DAUGHTER HAD BITTEN HER EAR. THE 
LITTLE GIRL, WHOM SHE CARRIED ON HER 
BACK, WAS A WILD AND RECKLESS CREATURE. 
"YOU BEASTY BRAT!" HER MOTHER EXCLAIMED, BUT 
IT KEPT HER FROM USING THAT KNIFE 
ON GERDA. "SHE SHALL PLAY WITH ME," 
SAID THE LITTLE ROBBER GIRL. "SHE MUST 
GIVE ME HER MUFF AND THAT PRETTY 
DRESS SHE WEARS, AND SLEEP WITH ME 
IN MY BED." AND SHE AGAIN GAVE 
HER MOTHER SUCH A BITE THAT THE 
WOMAN HOPPED AND WHIRLED AROUND IN PAIN. 
ALL THE ROBBERS LAUGHED, AND SHOUTED: "SEE 
HOW SHE DANCES WITH HER BRAT." "I 
WANT TO RIDE IN THE CARRIAGE," THE 
LITTLE ROBBER GIRL SAID, AND RIDE SHE 
DID, FOR SHE WAS TOO SPOILED AND 
HEADSTRONG FOR WORDS. SHE AND GERDA CLIMBED 
INTO THE CARRIAGE AND AWAY THEY DROVE 
OVER STUMPS AND STONES, INTO THE DEPTHS 
OF THE FOREST. THE LITTLE ROBBER GIRL 
WAS NO TALLER THAN GERDA, BUT SHE 
WAS STRONGER AND MUCH BROADER IN THE 
SHOULDERS. HER SKIN WAS BROWN AND HER 
EYES COAL-BLACK-ALMOST SAD IN THEIR EXPRESSION. SHE 
PUT HER ARMS AROUND GERDA, AND SAID: 
"THEY SHAN'T KILL YOU UNLESS I GET 
ANGRY WITH YOU. I THINK YOU MUST 
BE A PRINCESS." "NO, I'M NOT," SAID 
LITTLE GERDA. AND SHE TOLD ABOUT ALL 
THAT HAD HAPPENED TO HER, AND HOW 
MUCH SHE CARED FOR LITTLE KAY. THE 
ROBBER GIRL LOOKED AT HER GRAVELY, GAVE 
A LITTLE NOD OF APPROVAL, AND TOLD 
HER: "EVEN IF I SHOULD GET ANGRY 
WITH YOU, THEY SHAN'T KILL YOU, BECAUSE 
I'LL DO IT MYSELF!" THEN SHE DRIED 
GERDA'S EYES, AND STUCK HER OWN HANDS 
INTO GERDA'S SOFT, WARM MUFF. THE CARRIAGE 
STOPPED AT LAST, IN THE COURTYARD OF 
A ROBBER'S CASTLE. THE WALLS OF IT 
WERE CRACKED FROM BOTTOM TO TOP. CROWS 
AND RAVENS FLEW OUT OF EVERY LOOPHOLE, 
AND BULLDOGS HUGE ENOUGH TO DEVOUR A 
MAN JUMPED HIGH IN THE AIR. BUT 
THEY DID NOT BARK, FOR THAT WAS 
FORBIDDEN. IN THE MIDDLE OF THE STONE-PAVED, 
SMOKY OLD HALL, A BIG FIRE WAS 
BURNING. THE SMOKE OF IT DRIFTED UP 
TO THE CEILING, WHERE IT HAD TO 
FIND ITS OWN WAY OUT. SOUP WAS 
BOILING IN A BIG CALDRON, AND HARES 
AND RABBITS WERE ROASTING ON THE SPIT. 
"TONIGHT YOU SHALL SLEEP WITH ME AND 
ALL MY LITTLE ANIMALS," THE ROBBER GIRL 
SAID. AFTER THEY HAD SOMETHING TO EAT 
AND DRINK, THEY WENT OVER TO A 
CORNER THAT WAS STREWN WITH RUGS AND 
STRAW. ON STICKS AND PERCHES AROUND THE 
BEDDING ROOSTED NEARLY A HUNDRED PIGEONS. THEY 
SEEMED TO BE ASLEEP, BUT THEY STIRRED 
JUST A LITTLE WHEN THE TWO LITTLE 
GIRLS CAME NEAR THEM. "THEY ARE ALL 
MINE, " SAID THE LITTLE ROBBER GIRL. 
SHE SEIZED THE ONE THAT WAS NEAREST 
TO HER, HELD IT BY THE LEGS 
AND SHOOK IT UNTIL IT FLAPPED ITS 
WINGS. "KISS IT," SHE CRIED, AND THRUST 
THE BIRD IN GERDA'S FACE. "THOSE TWO 
ARE THE WILD RASCALS," SHE SAID, POINTING 
HIGH UP THE WALL TO A HOLE 
BARRED WITH WOODEN STICKS. "RASCALS OF THE 
WOODS THEY ARE, AND THEY WOULD FLY 
AWAY IN A MINUTE IF THEY WERE 
NOT LOCKED UP." "AND HERE IS MY 
OLD SWEETHEART, BAE," SHE SAID, PULLING AT 
THE HORNS OF A REINDEER THAT WAS 
TETHERED BY A SHINY COPPER RING AROUND 
HIS NECK. "WE HAVE TO KEEP A 
SHARP EYE ON HIM, OR HE WOULD 
RUN AWAY FROM US TOO. EVERY SINGLE 
NIGHT I TICKLE HIS NECK WITH MY 
KNIFE BLADE, FOR HE IS AFRAID OF 
THAT." FROM A HOLE IN THE WALL 
SHE PULLED A LONG KNIFE, AND RUBBED 
IT AGAINST THE REINDEER'S NECK. AFTER THE 
POOR ANIMAL HAD KICKED UP ITS HEALS, 
THE ROBBER GIRL LAUGHED AND PULLED GERDA 
DOWN INTO THE BED WITH HER. "ARE 
YOU GOING TO KEEP THAT KNIFE IN 
BED WITH YOU?" GERDA ASKED, AND LOOKED 
AT IT A LITTLE FRIGHTENED. "I ALWAYS 
SLEEP WITH MY KNIFE," THE LITTLE ROBBER 
GIRL SAID. "YOU NEVER CAN TELL WHAT 
MAY HAPPEN. BUT LET'S HEAR AGAIN WHAT 
YOU TOLD ME BEFORE ABOUT LITTLE KAY, 
AND ABOUT WHY YOU ARE WANDERING THROUGH 
THE WIDE WORLD." GERDA TOLD THE STORY 
ALL OVER AGAIN, WHILE THE WILD PIGEONS 
COOED IN THEIR CAGE OVERHEAD, AND THE 
TAME PIGEONS SLEPT. THE LITTLE ROBBER GIRL 
CLASPED ONE ARM AROUND GERDA'S NECK, GRIPPED 
HER KNIFE IN THE OTHER HAND, FELL 
ASLEEP, AND SNORED SO THAT ONE COULD 
HEAR HER. BUT GERDA COULD NOT CLOSE 
HER EYES AT ALL. SHE DID NOT 
KNOW WHETHER SHE WAS TO LIVE OR 
WHETHER SHE WAS TO DIE. THE ROBBERS 
SAT AROUND THEIR FIRE, SINGING AND DRINKING, 
AND THE OLD ROBBER WOMAN WAS TURNING 
SOMERSAULTS. IT WAS A TERRIBLE SIGHT FOR 
A LITTLE GIRL TO SEE. THEN THE 
WOOD PIGEONS SAID, "COO, COO. WE HAVE 
SEEN LITTLE KAY. A WHITE HEN WAS 
CARRYING HIS SLED, AND KAY SAT IN 
THE SNOW QUEEN'S SLEIGH. THEY SWOOPED LOW, 
OVER THE TREES WHERE WE LAY IN 
OUR NEST. THE SNOW QUEEN BLEW UPON 
US, AND ALL THE YOUNG PIGEONS DIED 
EXCEPT US. COO, COO." "WHAT IS THAT 
YOU ARE SAYING UP THERE?" CRIED GERDA. 
"WHERE WAS THE SNOW QUEEN GOING? DO 
YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT IT?" "SHE WAS 
PROBABLY BOUND FOR LAPLAND, WHERE THEY ALWAYS 
HAVE SNOW AND ICE. WHY DON'T YOU 
ASK THE REINDEER WHO IS TETHERED BESIDE 
YOU?" "YES, THERE IS ICE AND SNOW 
IN THAT GLORIOUS LAND," THE REINDEER TOLD 
HER. "YOU CAN PRANCE ABOUT FREELY ACROSS 
THOSE GREAT, GLITTERING FIELDS. THE SNOW QUEEN 
HAS HER SUMMER TENT THERE, BUT HER 
STRONGHOLD IS A CASTLE UP NEARER THE 
NORTH POLE, ON THE ISLAND CALLED SPITZBERGEN." 
"OH, KAY, LITTLE KAY," GERDA SIGHED. "LIE 
STILL," SAID THE ROBBER GIRL, "OR I'LL 
STICK MY KNIFE IN YOUR STOMACH." IN 
THE MORNING GERDA TOLD HER ALL THAT 
THE WOOD PIGEONS HAD SAID. THE LITTLE 
ROBBER GIRL LOOKED QUITE THOUGHTFUL. SHE NODDED 
HER HEAD, AND EXCLAIMED, "LEAVE IT TO 
ME! LEAVE IT TO ME. "DO YOU 
KNOW WHERE LAPLAND IS?" SHE ASKED THE 
REINDEER. "WHO KNOWS IT BETTER THAN I?" 
THE REINDEER SAID, AND HIS EYES SPARKLED. 
"THERE I WAS BORN, THERE I WAS 
BRED, AND THERE I KICKED MY HEELS 
IN FREEDOM, ACROSS THE FIELDS OF SNOW." 
"LISTEN!" THE ROBBER GIRL SAID TO GERDA. 
"AS YOU SEE, ALL THE MEN ARE 
AWAY. MOTHER IS STILL HERE, AND HERE 
SHE'LL STAY, BUT BEFORE THE MORNING IS 
OVER SHE WILL DRINK OUT OF THAT 
BIG BOTTLE, AND THEN SHE USUALLY DOZES 
OFF FOR A NAP. AS SOON AS 
THAT HAPPENS, I WILL DO YOU A 
GOOD TURN." SHE JUMPED OUT OF BED, 
RUSHED OVER AND THREW HER ARMS AROUND 
HER MOTHER'S NECK, PULLED AT HER BEARD 
BRISTLES, AND SAID, "GOOD MORNING, MY DEAR 
NANNY-GOAT." HER MOTHER THUMPED HER NOSE UNTIL 
IT WAS RED AND BLUE, BUT ALL 
THAT WAS DONE OUT OF PURE LOVE. 
AS SOON AS THE MOTHER HAD TIPPED 
UP THE BOTTLE AND DOZED OFF TO 
SLEEP, THE LITTLE ROBBER GIRL RAN TO 
THE REINDEER AND SAID, "I HAVE A 
GOOD NOTION TO KEEP YOU HERE, AND 
TICKLE YOU WITH MY SHARP KNIFE. YOU 
ARE SO FUNNY WHEN I DO, BUT 
NEVER MIND THAT. I'LL UNTIE YOUR ROPE, 
AND HELP YOU FIND YOUR WAY OUTSIDE, 
SO THAT YOU CAN RUN BACK TO 
LAPLAND. BUT YOU MUST PUT YOUR BEST 
LEG FORWARD AND CARRY THIS LITTLE GIRL 
TO THE SNOW QUEEN'S PALACE, WHERE HER 
PLAYMATE IS. I SUPPOSE YOU HEARD WHAT 
SHE TOLD ME, FOR SHE SPOKE SO 
LOUD, AND YOU WERE EAVESDROPPING." THE REINDEER 
WAS SO HAPPY THAT HE BOUNDED INTO 
THE AIR. THE ROBBER GIRL HOISTED LITTLE 
GERDA ON HIS BACK, CAREFULLY TIED HER 
IN PLACE, AND EVEN GAVE HER A 
LITTLE PILLOW TO SIT ON. I DON'T 
DO THINGS HALF WAY," SHE SAID. "HERE, 
TAKE BACK YOUR FUR BOOTS, FOR IT'S 
GOING TO BE BITTER COLD. I'LL KEEP 
YOUR MUFF, BECAUSE IT'S SUCH A PRETTY 
ONE. BUT YOUR FINGERS MUSTN'T GET COLD. 
HERE ARE MY MOTHER'S BIG MITTENS, WHICH 
WILL COME RIGHT UP TO YOUR ELBOWS. 
PULL THEM ON. NOW YOUR HANDS LOOK 
JUST LIKE MY UGLY MOTHER'S BIG PAWS." 
AND GERDA SHED HAPPY TEARS. "I DON'T 
CARE TO SEE YOU BLUBBERING," SAID THE 
LITTLE ROBBER GIRL. "YOU OUGHT TO LOOK 
PLEASED NOW. HERE, TAKE THESE TWO LOAVES 
OF BREAD AND THIS HAM ALONG, SO 
THAT YOU WON'T STARVE." WHEN THESE PROVISIONS 
WERE TIED ON THE BACK OF THE 
REINDEER, THE LITTLE ROBBER GIRL OPENED THE 
DOOR AND CALLED IN ALL THE BIG 
DOGS. THEN SHE CUT THE TETHER WITH 
HER KNIFE AND SAID TO THE REINDEER, 
"NOW RUN, BUT SEE THAT YOU TAKE 
GOOD CARE OF THE LITTLE GIRL." GERDA 
WAVED HER BIG MITTENS TO THE LITTLE 
ROBBER GIRL, AND SAID GOOD-BY. THEN THE 
REINDEER BOUNDED AWAY, OVER STUMPS AND STONES, 
STRAIGHT THROUGH THE GREAT FOREST, OVER SWAMPS 
AND ACROSS THE PLAINS, AS FAST AS 
HE COULD RUN. THE WOLVES HOWLED, THE 
RAVENS SHRIEKED, AND KER-SHEW, KER-SHEW! THE RED 
STREAKS OF LIGHT RIPPED THROUGH THE HEAVENS, 
WITH A NOISE THAT SOUNDED LIKE SNEEZING. 
"THOSE ARE MY OLD NORTHERN LIGHTS," SAID 
THE REINDEER. "SEE HOW THEY FLASH." AND 
ON HE RAN, FASTER THAN EVER, BY 
NIGHT AND DAY. THE LOAVES WERE EATEN 
AND THE WHOLE HAM WAS EATEN-AND THERE 
THEY WERE IN LAPLAND. SIXTH STORY THE 
LAPP WOMAN AND THE FINN WOMAN THEY 
STOPPED IN FRONT OF THE LITTLE HUT, 
AND A MAKESHIFT DWELLING IT WAS. THE 
ROOF OF IT ALMOST TOUCHED THE GROUND, 
AND THE DOORWAY WAS SO LOW THAT 
THE FAMILY HAD TO LIE ON THEIR 
STOMACHS TO CRAWL IN IT OR OUT 
OF IT. NO ONE WAS AT HOME 
EXCEPT AN OLD LAPP WOMAN, WHO WAS 
COOKING FISH OVER A WHALE-OIL LAMP. THE 
REINDEER TOLD HER GERDA'S WHOLE STORY, BUT 
FIRST HE TOLD HIS OWN, WHICH HE 
THOUGHT WAS MUCH MORE IMPORTANT. BESIDES, GERDA 
WAS SO COLD THAT SHE COULDN'T SAY 
A THING. "OH, YOU POOR CREATURES," THE 
LAPP WOMAN SAID, "YOU'VE STILL GOT SUCH 
A LONG WAY TO GO. WHY, YOU 
WILL HAVE TO TRAVEL HUNDREDS OF MILES 
INTO THE FINMARK. FOR IT'S THERE THAT 
THE SNOW QUEEN IS TAKING A COUNTRY 
VACATION, AND BURNING HER BLUE FIREWORKS EVERY 
EVENING. I'LL JOT DOWN A MESSAGE ON 
A DRIED CODFISH, FOR I HAVEN'T ANY 
PAPER. I WANT YOU TO TAKE IT 
TO THE FINN WOMAN WHO LIVES UP 
THERE. SHE WILL BE ABLE TO TELL 
YOU MORE ABOUT IT THAN I CAN." 
AS SOON AS GERDA HAD THAWED OUT, 
AND HAD HAD SOMETHING TO EAT AND 
DRINK, THE LAPP WOMAN WROTE A FEW 
WORDS ON A DRIED CODFISH, TOLD GERDA 
TO TAKE GOOD CARE OF IT, AND 
TIED HER AGAIN ON THE BACK OF 
THE REINDEER. OFF HE RAN, AND ALL 
NIGHT LONG THE SKIES CRACKLED AND SWISHED 
AS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL NORTHERN LIGHTS FLASHED 
OVER THEIR HEADS. AT LAST THEY CAME 
TO THE FINMARK, AND KNOCKED AT THE 
FINN WOMAN'S CHIMNEY, FOR SHE HADN'T A 
SIGN OF A DOOR. IT WAS SO 
HOT INSIDE THAT THE FINN WOMAN WENT 
ABOUT ALMOST NAKED. SHE WAS SMALL AND 
TERRIBLY DOWDY, BUT SHE AT ONCE HELPED 
LITTLE GERDA OFF WITH HER MITTENS AND 
BOOTS, AND LOOSENED HER CLOTHES. OTHERWISE THE 
HEAT WOULD HAVE WILTED HER. THEN THE 
WOMAN PUT A PIECE OF ICE ON 
THE REINDEER'S HEAD, AND READ WHAT WAS 
WRITTEN ON THE CODFISH. SHE READ IT 
THREE TIMES AND WHEN SHE KNEW IT 
BY HEART, SHE PUT THE FISH INTO 
THE KETTLE OF SOUP, FOR THEY MIGHT 
AS WELL EAT IT. SHE NEVER WASTED 
ANYTHING. THE REINDEER TOLD HER HIS OWN 
STORY FIRST, AND THEN LITTLE GERDA'S. THE 
FINN WOMAN WINKED A KNOWING EYE, BUT 
SHE DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING. "YOU ARE SUCH 
A WISE WOMAN," SAID THE REINDEER, "I 
KNOW THAT YOU CAN TIE ALL THE 
WINDS OF THE WORLD TOGETHER WITH A 
BIT OF COTTON THREAD. IF THE SAILOR 
UNTIES ONE KNOT HE GETS A FAVORABLE 
WIND. IF HE UNTIES ANOTHER HE GETS 
A STIFF GALE, WHILE IF HE UNTIES 
THE THIRD AND FOURTH KNOTS SUCH A 
TEMPEST RAGES THAT IT FLATTENS THE TREES 
IN THE FOREST. WON'T YOU GIVE THIS 
LITTLE GIRL SOMETHING TO DRINK THAT WILL 
MAKE HER AS STRONG AS TWELVE MEN, 
SO THAT SHE MAY OVERPOWER THE SNOW 
QUEEN?" "TWELVE STRONG MEN," THE FINN WOMAN 
SNIFFED. " MUCH GOOD THAT WOULD BE." 
SHE WENT TO THE SHELF, TOOK DOWN 
A BIG ROLLED-UP SKIN, AND UNROLLED IT. 
ON THIS SKIN STRANGE CHARACTERS WERE WRITTEN, 
AND THE FINN WOMAN READ THEM UNTIL 
THE SWEAT ROLLED DOWN HER FOREHEAD. THE 
REINDEER AGAIN BEGGED HER TO HELP GERDA, 
AND LITTLE GERDA LOOKED AT HER WITH 
SUCH TEARFUL, IMPLORING EYES, THAT THE WOMAN 
BEGAN WINKING AGAIN. SHE TOOK THE REINDEER 
ASIDE IN A CORNER, AND WHILE SHE 
WAS PUTTING ANOTHER PIECE OF ICE ON 
HIS HEAD SHE WHISPERED TO HIM: "LITTLE 
KAY IS INDEED WITH THE SNOW QUEEN, 
AND EVERYTHING THERE JUST SUITS HIM FINE. 
HE THINKS IT IS THE BEST PLACE 
IN ALL THE WORLD, BUT THAT'S BECAUSE 
HE HAS A SPLINTER OF GLASS IN 
HIS HEART AND A SMALL PIECE OF 
IT IN HIS EYE. UNLESS THESE CAN 
BE GOTTEN OUT, HE WILL NEVER BE 
HUMAN AGAIN, AND THE SNOW QUEEN WILL 
HOLD HIM IN HER POWER." "BUT CAN'T 
YOU FIX LITTLE GERDA SOMETHING TO DRINK 
WHICH WILL GIVE HER MORE POWER THAN 
ALL THOSE THINGS?" "NO POWER THAT I 
COULD GIVE COULD BE AS GREAT AS 
THAT WHICH SHE ALREADY HAS. DON'T YOU 
SEE HOW MEN AND BEASTS ARE COMPELLED 
TO SERVE HER, AND HOW FAR SHE 
HAS COME IN THE WIDE WORLD SINCE 
SHE STARTED OUT IN HER NAKED FEET? 
WE MUSTN'T TELL HER ABOUT THIS POWER. 
STRENGTH LIES IN HER HEART, BECAUSE SHE 
IS SUCH A SWEET, INNOCENT CHILD. IF 
SHE HERSELF CANNOT REACH THE SNOW QUEEN 
AND RID LITTLE KAY OF THOSE PIECES 
OF GLASS, THEN THERE'S NO HELP THAT 
WE CAN GIVE HER. THE SNOW QUEEN'S 
GARDEN LIES ABOUT EIGHT MILES FROM HERE. 
YOU MAY CARRY THE LITTLE GIRL THERE, 
AND PUT HER DOWN BY THE BIG 
BUSH COVERED WITH RED BERRIES THAT GROWS 
ON THE SNOW. THEN DON'T YOU STAND 
THERE GOSSIPING, BUT HURRY TO GET BACK 
HERE."? THE FINN WOMAN LIFTED LITTLE GERDA 
ONTO THE REINDEER, AND HE GALLOPED AWAY 
AS FAST AS HE COULD. "OH!" CRIED 
GERDA, "I FORGOT MY BOOTS AND I 
FORGOT MY MITTENS." SHE SOON FELT THE 
NEED OF THEM IN THAT KNIFE-LIKE COLD, 
BUT THE REINDEER DID NOT DARE TO 
STOP. HE GALLOPED ON UNTIL THEY CAME 
TO THE BIG BUSH THAT WAS COVERED 
WITH RED BERRIES. HERE HE SET GERDA 
DOWN AND KISSED HER ON THE MOUTH, 
WHILE BIG SHINING TEARS RAN DOWN HIS 
FACE. THEN HE RAN BACK AS FAST 
AS HE COULD. LITTLE GERDA STOOD THERE 
WITHOUT BOOTS AND WITHOUT MITTENS, RIGHT IN 
THE MIDDLE OF ICY FINMARK. SHE RAN 
AS FAST AS EVER SHE COULD. A 
WHOLE REGIMENT OF SNOWFLAKES SWIRLED TOWARD HER, 
BUT THEY DID NOT FALL FROM THE 
SKY, FOR THERE WAS NOT A CLOUD 
UP THERE, AND THE NORTHERN LIGHTS WERE 
ABLAZE. THE FLAKES SKIRMISHED ALONG THE GROUND, 
AND THE NEARER THEY CAME THE LARGER 
THEY GREW. GERDA REMEMBERED HOW LARGE AND 
STRANGE THEY HAD APPEARED WHEN SHE LOOKED 
AT THEM UNDER THE MAGNIFYING GLASS. BUT 
HERE THEY WERE MUCH MORE MONSTROUS AND 
TERRIFYING. THEY WERE ALIVE. THEY WERE THE 
SNOW QUEEN'S ADVANCE GUARD, AND THEIR SHAPES 
WERE MOST STRANGE. SOME LOOKED LIKE UGLY, 
OVERGROWN PORCUPINES. SOME WERE LIKE A KNOT 
OF SNAKES THAT STUCK OUT THEIR HEADS 
IN EVERY DIRECTION, AND OTHERS WERE LIKE 
FAT LITTLE BEARS WITH EVERY HAIR A-BRISTLE. 
ALL OF THEM WERE GLISTENING WHITE, FOR 
ALL WERE LIVING SNOWFLAKES. IT WAS SO 
COLD THAT, AS LITTLE GERDA SAID THE 
LORD'S PRAYER, SHE COULD SEE HER BREATH 
FREEZING IN FRONT OF HER MOUTH, LIKE 
A CLOUD OF SMOKE. IT GREW THICKER 
AND THICKER, AND TOOK THE SHAPE OF 
LITTLE ANGELS THAT GREW BIGGER AND BIGGER 
THE MOMENT THEY TOUCHED THE GROUND. ALL 
OF THEM HAD HELMETS ON THEIR HEADS 
AND THEY CARRIED SHIELDS AND LANCES IN 
THEIR HANDS. RANK UPON RANK, THEY INCREASED, 
AND WHEN GERDA HAD FINISHED HER PRAYER 
SHE WAS SURROUNDED BY A LEGION OF 
ANGELS. THEY STRUCK THE DREAD SNOWFLAKES WITH 
THEIR LANCES AND SHIVERED THEM INTO A 
THOUSAND PIECES. LITTLE GERDA WALKED ON, UNMOLESTED 
AND CHEERFUL. THE ANGELS RUBBED HER HANDS 
AND FEET TO MAKE THEM WARMER, AND 
SHE TROTTED BRISKLY ALONG TO THE SNOW 
QUEEN'S PALACE. BUT NOW LET US SEE 
HOW LITTLE KAY WAS GETTING ON. LITTLE 
GERDA WAS FURTHEST FROM HIS MIND, AND 
HE HADN'T THE SLIGHTEST IDEA THAT SHE 
WAS JUST OUTSIDE THE PALACE. SEVENTH STORY 
WHAT HAPPENED IN THE SNOW QUEEN'S PALACE 
AND WHAT CAME OF IT THE WALLS 
OF THE PALACE WERE DRIVEN SNOW. THE 
WINDOWS AND DOORS WERE THE KNIFE-EDGED WIND. 
THERE WERE MORE THAN A HUNDRED HALLS, 
SHAPED AS THE SNOW HAD DRIFTED, AND 
THE LARGEST OF THESE EXTENDED FOR MANY 
A MILE. ALL WERE LIGHTED BY THE 
FLARE OF THE NORTHERN LIGHTS. ALL OF 
THE HALLS WERE SO IMMENSE AND SO 
EMPTY, SO BRILLIANT AND SO GLACIAL! THERE 
WAS NEVER A TOUCH OF GAIETY IN 
THEM; NEVER SO MUCH AS A LITTLE 
DANCE FOR THE POLAR BEARS, AT WHICH 
THE STORM BLAST COULD HAVE SERVED FOR 
MUSIC, AND THE POLAR BEARS COULD HAVE 
WADDLED ABOUT ON THEIR HIND LEGS TO 
SHOW OFF THEIR BEST MANNERS. THERE WAS 
NEVER A LITTLE PARTY WITH SUCH GAMES 
AS BLIND-BEAR'S BUFF OR HIDE THE PAW-KERCHIEF 
FOR THE CUBS, NOR EVEN A LITTLE 
AFTERNOON COFFEE OVER WHICH THE WHITE FOX 
VIXENS COULD GOSSIP. EMPTY, VAST, AND FRIGID 
WERE THE SNOW QUEEN'S HALLS. THE NORTHERN 
LIGHTS FLARED WITH SUCH REGULARITY THAT YOU 
COULD TIME EXACTLY WHEN THEY WOULD BE 
AT THE HIGHEST AND LOWEST. IN THE 
MIDDLE OF THE VAST, EMPTY HALL OF 
SNOW WAS A FROZEN LAKE. IT WAS 
CRACKED INTO A THOUSAND PIECES, BUT EACH 
PIECE WAS SHAPED SO EXACTLY LIKE THE 
OTHERS THAT IT SEEMED A WORK OF 
WONDERFUL CRAFTSMANSHIP. THE SNOW QUEEN SAT IN 
THE EXACT CENTER OF IT WHEN SHE 
WAS AT HOME, AND SHE SPOKE OF 
THIS AS SITTING ON HER "MIRROR OF 
REASON." SHE SAID THIS MIRROR WAS THE 
ONLY ONE OF ITS KIND, AND THE 
BEST THING IN ALL THE WORLD. LITTLE 
KAY WAS BLUE, YES, ALMOST BLACK, WITH 
THE COLD. BUT HE DID NOT FEEL 
IT, BECAUSE THE SNOW QUEEN HAD KISSED 
AWAY HIS ICY TREMBLINGS, AND HIS HEART 
ITSELF HAD ALMOST TURNED TO ICE. HE 
WAS SHIFTING SOME SHARP, FLAT PIECES OF 
ICE TO AND FRO, TRYING TO FIT 
THEM INTO EVERY POSSIBLE PATTERN, FOR HE 
WANTED TO MAKE SOMETHING WITH THEM. IT 
WAS LIKE THE CHINESE PUZZLE GAME THAT 
WE PLAY AT HOME, JUGGLING LITTLE FLAT 
PIECES OF WOOD ABOUT INTO SPECIAL DESIGNS. 
KAY WAS CLEVERLY ARRANGING HIS PIECES IN 
THE GAME OF ICE-COLD REASON. TO HIM 
THE PATTERNS WERE HIGHLY REMARKABLE AND OF 
THE UTMOST IMPORTANCE, FOR THE CHIP OF 
GLASS IN HIS EYE MADE HIM SEE 
THEM THAT WAY. HE ARRANGED HIS PIECES 
TO SPELL OUT MANY WORDS; BUT HE 
COULD NEVER FIND THE WAY TO MAKE 
THE ONE WORD HE WAS SO EAGER 
TO FORM. THE WORD WAS "ETERNITY." THE 
SNOW QUEEN HAD SAID TO HIM, "IF 
YOU CAN PUZZLE THAT OUT YOU SHALL 
BE YOUR OWN MASTER, AND I'LL GIVE 
YOU THE WHOLE WORLD AND A NEW 
PAIR OF SKATES." BUT HE COULD NOT 
PUZZLE IT OUT. "NOW I AM GOING 
TO MAKE A FLYING TRIP TO THE 
WARM COUNTRIES," THE SNOW QUEEN TOLD HIM. 
"I WANT TO GO AND TAKE A 
LOOK INTO THE BLACK CALDRONS." SHE MEANT 
THE VOLCANOS OF ETNA AND VESUVIUS. "I 
MUST WHITEN THEM UP A BIT. THEY 
NEED IT, AND IT WILL BE SUCH 
A RELIEF AFTER ALL THOSE YELLOW LEMONS 
AND PURPLE GRAPES." AND AWAY SHE FLEW. 
KAY SAT ALL ALONE IN THAT ENDLESS, 
EMPTY, FRIGID HALL, AND PUZZLED OVER THE 
PIECES OF ICE UNTIL HE ALMOST CRACKED 
HIS SKULL. HE SAT SO STIFF AND 
STILL THAT ONE MIGHT HAVE THOUGHT HE 
WAS FROZEN TO DEATH. ALL OF A 
SUDDEN, LITTLE GERDA WALKED UP TO THE 
PALACE THROUGH THE GREAT GATE WHICH WAS 
A KNIFE-EDGED WIND. BUT GERDA SAID HER 
EVENING PRAYER. THE WIND WAS LULLED TO 
REST, AND THE LITTLE GIRL CAME ON 
INTO THE VAST, COLD, EMPTY HALL. THEN 
SHE SAW KAY. SHE RECOGNIZED HIM AT 
ONCE, AND RAN TO THROW HER ARMS 
AROUND HIM. SHE HELD HIM CLOSE AND 
CRIED, "KAY, DEAREST LITTLE KAY! I'VE FOUND 
YOU AT LAST!" BUT HE SAT STILL, 
AND STIFF, AND COLD. GERDA SHED HOT 
TEARS, AND WHEN THEY FELL UPON HIM 
THEY WENT STRAIGHT TO HIS HEART. THEY 
MELTED THE LUMP OF ICE AND BURNED 
AWAY THE SPLINTER OF GLASS IN IT. 
HE LOOKED UP AT HER, AND SHE 
SANG: "WHERE ROSES BLOOM SO SWEETLY IN 
THE VALE, THERE SHALL YOU FIND THE 
CHRIST CHILD, WITHOUT FAIL." KAY BURST INTO 
TEARS. HE CRIED SO FREELY THAT THE 
LITTLE PIECE OF GLASS IN HIS EYE 
WAS WASHED RIGHT OUT. "GERDA!" HE KNEW 
HER, AND CRIED OUT IN HIS HAPPINESS, 
"MY SWEET LITTLE GERDA, WHERE HAVE YOU 
BEEN SO LONG? AND WHERE HAVE I 
BEEN?" HE LOOKED AROUND HIM AND SAID, 
"HOW COLD IT IS HERE! HOW ENORMOUS 
AND EMPTY!" HE HELD FAST TO GERDA, 
WHO LAUGHED UNTIL HAPPY TEARS ROLLED DOWN 
HER CHEEKS. THEIR BLISS WAS SO HEAVENLY 
THAT EVEN THE BITS OF GLASS DANCED 
ABOUT THEM AND SHARED IN THEIR HAPPINESS. 
WHEN THE PIECES GREW TIRED, THEY DROPPED 
INTO A PATTERN WHICH MADE THE VERY 
WORD THAT THE SNOW QUEEN HAD TOLD 
KAY HE MUST FIND BEFORE HE BECAME 
HIS OWN MASTER AND RECEIVED THE WHOLE 
WORLD AND A NEW PAIR OF SKATES. 
GERDA KISSED HIS CHEEKS, AND THEY TURNED 
PINK AGAIN. SHE KISSED HIS EYES, AND 
THEY SPARKLED LIKE HERS. SHE KISSED HIS 
HANDS AND FEET, AND HE BECAME STRONG 
AND WELL. THE SNOW QUEEN MIGHT COME 
HOME NOW WHENEVER SHE PLEASED, FOR THERE 
STOOD THE ORDER FOR KAY'S RELEASE, WRITTEN 
IN LETTERS OF SHINING ICE. HAND IN 
HAND, KAY AND GERDA STROLLED OUT OF 
THAT ENORMOUS PALACE. THEY TALKED ABOUT GRANDMOTHER, 
AND ABOUT THE ROSES ON THEIR ROOF. 
WHEREVER THEY WENT, THE WIND DIED DOWN 
AND THE SUN SHONE OUT. WHEN THEY 
CAME TO THE BUSH THAT WAS COVERED 
WITH RED BERRIES, THE REINDEER WAS WAITING 
TO MEET THEM. HE HAD BROUGHT ALONG 
A YOUNG REINDEER MATE WHO HAD WARM 
MILK FOR THE CHILDREN TO DRINK, AND 
WHO KISSED THEM ON THE MOUTH. THEN 
THESE REINDEER CARRIED GERDA AND KAY FIRST 
TO THE FINN WOMAN. THEY WARMED THEMSELVES 
IN HER HOT ROOM, AND WHEN SHE 
HAD GIVEN THEM DIRECTIONS FOR THEIR JOURNEY 
HOME THEY RODE ON TO THE LAPP 
WOMAN. SHE HAD MADE THEM NEW CLOTHES, 
AND WAS READY TO TAKE THEM ALONG 
IN HER SLEIGH. SIDE BY SIDE, THE 
REINDEER RAN WITH THEM TO THE LIMITS 
OF THE NORTH COUNTRY, WHERE THE FIRST 
GREEN BUDS WERE TO BE SEEN. HERE 
THEY SAID GOOD-BY TO THE TWO REINDEER 
AND TO THE LAPP WOMAN. "FAREWELL," THEY 
ALL SAID. NOW THE FIRST LITTLE BIRDS 
BEGAN TO CHIRP, AND THERE WERE GREEN 
BUDS ALL AROUND THEM IN THE FOREST. 
THROUGH THE WOODS CAME RIDING A YOUNG 
GIRL ON A MAGNIFICENT HORSE THAT GERDA 
RECOGNIZED, FOR IT HAD ONCE BEEN HARNESSED 
TO THE GOLDEN CARRIAGE. THE GIRL WORE 
A BRIGHT RED CAP ON HER HEAD, 
AND A PAIR OF PISTOLS IN HER 
BELT. SHE WAS THE LITTLE ROBBER GIRL, 
WHO HAD GROWN TIRED OF STAYING AT 
HOME, AND WHO WAS SETTING OUT ON 
A JOURNEY TO THE NORTH COUNTRY. IF 
SHE DIDN'T LIKE IT THERE, WHY, THE 
WORLD WAS WIDE, AND THERE WERE MANY 
OTHER PLACES WHERE SHE COULD GO. SHE 
RECOGNIZED GERDA AT ONCE, AND GERDA KNEW 
HER TOO. IT WAS A HAPPY MEETING. 
"YOU'RE A FINE ONE FOR GADDING ABOUT," 
SHE TOLD LITTLE KAY. "I'D JUST LIKE 
TO KNOW WHETHER YOU DESERVE TO HAVE 
SOMEONE RUNNING TO THE END OF THE 
EARTH FOR YOUR SAKE." BUT GERDA PATTED 
HER CHEEK AND ASKED HER ABOUT THE 
PRINCE AND THE PRINCESS. "THEY ARE TRAVELING 
IN FOREIGN LANDS," THE GIRL TOLD HER. 
"AND THE CROW?" "OH, THE CROW IS 
DEAD," SHE ANSWERED. "HIS TAME LADYLOVE IS 
NOW A WIDOW, AND SHE WEARS A 
BIT OF BLACK WOOL WRAPPED AROUND HER 
LEG. SHE TAKES GREAT PITY ON HERSELF, 
BUT THAT'S ALL STUFF AND NONSENSE. NOW 
TELL ME WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO YOU 
AND HOW YOU CAUGHT UP WITH KAY." 
GERDA AND KAY TOLD HER THEIR STORY. 
"SNIP SNAP SNURRE, BASSE LURRE," SAID THE 
ROBBER GIRL. "SO EVERYTHING CAME OUT ALL 
RIGHT." SHE SHOOK THEM BY THE HAND, 
AND PROMISED THAT IF EVER SHE PASSED 
THROUGH THEIR TOWN SHE WOULD COME TO 
SEE THEM. AND THEN SHE RODE AWAY. 
KAY AND GERDA HELD EACH OTHER BY 
THE HAND. AND AS THEY WALKED ALONG 
THEY HAD WONDERFUL SPRING WEATHER. THE LAND 
WAS GREEN AND STREWN WITH FLOWERS, CHURCH 
BELLS RANG, AND THEY SAW THE HIGH 
STEEPLES OF A BIG TOWN. IT WAS 
THE ONE WHERE THEY USED TO LIVE. 
THEY WALKED STRAIGHT TO GRANDMOTHER'S HOUSE, AND 
UP THE STAIRS, AND INTO THE ROOM, 
WHERE EVERYTHING WAS JUST AS IT WAS 
WHEN THEY LEFT IT. AND THE CLOCK 
SAID TICK-TOCK, AND ITS HANDS WERE TELLING 
THE TIME. BUT THE MOMENT THEY CAME 
IN THE DOOR THEY NOTICED ONE CHANGE. 
THEY WERE GROWN-UP NOW. THE ROSES ON 
THE ROOF LOOKED IN AT THE OPEN 
WINDOW, AND THEIR TWO LITTLE STOOLS WERE 
STILL OUT THERE. KAY AND GERDA SAT 
DOWN ON THEM, AND HELD EACH OTHER 
BY THE HAND. BOTH OF THEM HAD 
FORGOTTEN THE ICY, EMPTY SPLENDOR OF THE 
SNOW QUEEN'S PALACE AS COMPLETELY AS IF 
IT WERE SOME BAD DREAM. GRANDMOTHER SAT 
IN GOD'S GOOD SUNSHINE, READING TO THEM 
FROM HER BIBLE: "EXCEPT YE BECOME AS 
LITTLE CHILDREN, YE SHALL NOT ENTER INTO 
THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN." KAY AND GERDA 
LOOKED INTO EACH OTHER'S EYES, AND AT 
LAST THEY UNDERSTOOD THE MEANING OF THEIR 
OLD HYMN: "WHERE ROSES BLOOM SO SWEETLY 
IN THE VALE, THERE SHALL YOU FIND 
THE CHRIST CHILD, WITHOUT FAIL." AND THEY 
SAT THERE, GROWN-UP, BUT CHILDREN STILL-CHILDREN AT 
HEART. AND IT WAS SUMMER, WARM, GLORIOUS 
SUMMER.
